Often people perceive me as someone who would\nhave high grades, but when I tell them my grades, they are surprised. When\nprofessors reflect on my performance, they are often disappointed. My academics\nproduce more anxiety than most other parts of my life. I get upset for not\ndoing as well as I could, then I tell myself to stop taking pity on myself, and\nsay that if I just try harder, or devote more time to my work, then I could\nfinally grasp high understanding of what I’m learning. Maybe I could even challenge\nsome assertions made the professor. Putting in insufficient effort upsets me.\nLow effort dishonors the hard work of my professors; however, Ann Seavey in the\nAcademic Support Center tells me that I simply cannot maximize all values. If I\nwant to do excellently in certain arenas, I’m going to have to drop my\ncommitments or pull back from others. The tension that arises from many\ncommitments leads me to want less commitments. I denied the RA position offered\nme for next year because I want more time to put into my academic tasks. I hope\nthat this essay will give me insight into what turned me into a mediocre\nstudent. Through this essay I hope to reframe how I understand my past and\ndecide on a response that will make me a better student.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I will frame this\nessay in the same way H. Richard Niebuhr in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The\nResponsible Self</i> framed his description of his third symbol for acting in\nthe world: cathekontic, hermeneutical, responsible, or man-the-answerer; I will\nuse his model to situate myself and frame my questions.<a style='mso-footnote-id:\nftn1' href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[1]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nIn this model, Niebuhr urges me to ask, “what is going on? What is the\nsituation around me?” then, I ought to form an interpretation of the\ncircumstances in which I find myself, and finally, create a response.<a\nstyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[2]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nA fitting response involves a few aspects: what we experience, how we\nunderstand those experiences, it answers to an anticipated response, and it\nmake this response within a continuing community of agents<span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference> <a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href=\"#_ftn3\"\nname=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[3]</span></span><![endif]></span></a></span>\nWhat ought to come into fruition defines the good, the proper way defines the\nright, how we should act. The fitting determines the good and the right. We\nmust take much into consideration when choosing a response: actions upon us, how\nwe interpret that action, how others will respond to this action, and realizing\nthat this action will impact a continuing community of agents. These subpoints\nof the fitting lead to a decision to be or do that has apprehended the many\neffects which affect, as well as the many effects it may affect. According to Niebuhr,\nwe must contemplate four contexts when deliberating on a response: social,\nhistoric, religious, and with regards to sin &amp; salvation. Each of these\ncontexts influence us when determining our ethics; a careful analysis of each\none leads to the best decisions. I will walk through each of these major\ncomponents of Niebuhr’s model for responsible action as they are related to my\nethics as a student: what actions are upon me, how I interpret them,\nanticipated response, my continuing effect on a community of agents, and how I\nrespond. In each aspect I will consider the various contexts.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What is going on?\nSocially, the ways others have acted affects the way I perceive what defines an\nexcellent student. I listen to Hannah draw out examples in relation to the\nconversation; Bryan making connections to philosophical ideas and movements;\nChapman asking questions which beg further illumination of the ideas you\npresent. These actions affect me by creating a sense of longing: to respond\nwith pertinent examples, relevant questions, or insightful connections, because\nthen I would become a better student. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another element of\nwhat is going on socially is the influences that cause my thinking to become a\ncertain way. My boss Jesse Torres has become a mentor figure for me. At times when\nmeeting we will discuss my responsibilities as a student. How do I order my\npriorities when it comes to deciding how to use time? My primary\nresponsibilities are as an RA because I am paid, but second to that come\nstudent activities. When I do not want to do something, I ought to do it. When\nI am tempted to spend too much time doing something, these conversations have\nhelped reinforce the idea that I ought to not worry about fitting these\nassignments to the standards of my standards of perfection, but rather fit them\nto the needs of the assignment. These interactions have inculcated in me a\nsense of greater ownership over my work, and they have developed in me a lower\ntolerance for late work, as often my standards prioritize late excellent work\nover timely average work, as my submission for this paper demonstrates my\ntendency towards late work. Ideally, I would turn in timely excellent work,\nwhich is very possible.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What is going on\ntemporally? With regards to what has happened in my past, and in the past\nsurrounding me as a student, countless things have added to my situation. I am\nin a Western society with mostly German influenced teaching styles, rather than\nthe Oxford type education which has smaller classes and nearly exclusive essays.\nThis has led me to a higher likelihood of coming into a school like this, which\nis run in the larger German style. Gordon seems a mix of both. While this type\nof grading allows for some great things, like my nationally standardized\norganic chemistry final, it limits the amount of practice students have in\npaper writing and discussion with professors over subject material. I would\nhave loved to have a St. John’s Oxford style education through Gordon where I regularly\nsit with classmates and professors and discuss the material, similarly to how Foundations\nof Work and Vocation is set up.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What is going on\nin the religious context of my life? My experiences are in Christianity almost\nexclusively, and I have acted towards others taking their word and basking my\nactions on the belief that what they were going to say is true. Throughout high\nschool and middle school I went to school and youth group. During high school I\nacted to get others to like me. Despite my behaviors of not telling the truth\nto my parents about what I was doing—they didn’t ask me. When my mom pressed me\nfor details about my work I would get on a sour mood and turn away from her. I\ndid not want to be bothered by my family to do work. I could do it myself I\nfigured, and I found that if they told me what to do, I felt insulted. Looking\nat my time senior year, I would sit down to do work and fall asleep at my\nbooks. I never sat down for long to do work. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How do I interpret\nall of this in my past? I want to examine how I currently interpret it, and\nthen determine where I need to reinterpret it. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I see myself now\nas a decent student with much room for improvement. My interpretation of myself\nmay lead to a limiting view on myself, as I interpret my past as having <span\nclass=GramE>lead</span> up to a current status of mediocre performance with\ngreat potential. I look at my past as having not prepared me well for excellent\nacademia now. I see myself as having a lot of catching up to do. I consider\nlaziness to be the reason for much of my lack of hard, excellent work in high\nschool. I understand the reason for poor academic performance my supremely high\nvalue of friendships through high school. However, there are many aspects which\ncontributed to this behavior, to me being a student who can do well but does\nnot do as well as he could. I view myself as not putting enough time into my work\nto do excellently. I also am not ready enough to fail at what I am doing. If I\nhave a student attitude like that described by Jane Kendall et al. in <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Combining Service and Learning</i>, which is\none of willingness to fail in participating in class.<a style='mso-footnote-id:\nftn4' href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[4]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nKendall et al. paint an image of an ideal learning community, writing that\n“when people in a classroom begin to learn that every attempt at truth … is a\ncontribution to the larger search for … truth, they are soon emboldened … to\nsay what they need to say, to expose their ignorance, to do, in short, those\nthings without which learning can’t happen.” Learning at its best requires a\nhumble spirit, and if I see my past as ingraining in me an attitude of humility\nin school, then I will be a more humble, willing “to expose … [my] ignorance”\ntype of student. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I reinterpret my\npast as one which has given me foundation to become the type of student which\nSteven Garber seems to idealize in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The\nFabric of Faithfulness</i>—thoughtful, articulate, yet not asking questions and\nexercising intellect emptily.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href=\"#_ftn5\"\nname=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[5]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nThis student does not inquire without action and life to back up the ideas he\nspews off and questions. Garber references Augustine’s correspondence with an\nexcellent student, and in the midst of his response Augustine exhorts him to\nmake sure he is living out the truths he is looking to teach, and that he ought\nto have compassion towards others. He admonishes this scholar to live a life\nwhich attracts people to want to learn from him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Finally, now that\nI’ve laid out my experiences and interpretation, it is time for me to\ndeliberate on and choose a response. I want to respond to my current situation.\nAs I am realizing that I do have a past which has formed me to put excellent\nwork as a high priority and has given me the potential to do excellent work,\nand to please my professors by good work handed in early. This will be hard to\nattain, but with work, and continual reflection on what has brought me to my\ncurrent state, and how I interpret that, and how I respond to it, if I do this\nprocess in moments and little acts like choosing how much time to study one\nday, I can ask, what kind of student am I? And I will know that I am the kind\nof student which Augustine praises. Then I can ask, “what type of work does\nthat student do?” My answer will guide me in the direction of what kind of\nstudent I should be. I will work hard, be humble to come for help, be in\nconversation and friendship with my peers and professors, start work as it is\nassigned and have it ready before it is due. Most importantly, as the role of a\nstudent is to learn and have one’s life freed (I am, to be specific, a <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>liberal arts</i> student, a student studying\nthat which is thought to set people free), through my excellence being a\nstudent I will grow and become one who is thoughtful and better able to care\nfor those around me, and those who I contact in the future. I am a student who\nworks hard, ask questions which may be stupid but really need to have answered,\nand compassionately lives truth.</p>\n\n<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'><br\nclear=all style='mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always'>\n</span>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<w:Sdt SdtDocPart=\"t\" DocPartType=\"Bibliographies\" DocPartUnique=\"t\"\n ID=\"43565036\">\n <h1 style='line-height:200%'>Bibliography<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;\n line-height:200%;mso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:\n minor-fareast;mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";mso-bidi-font-weight:\n normal'><w:sdtPr></w:sdtPr></span></h1>\n <w:Sdt Bibliography=\"t\" ID=\"111145805\">\n  <p class=MsoBibliography style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;\n  line-height:200%'><!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\n  style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>BIBLIOGRAPHY <span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span><![endif]--><span\n  style='mso-no-proof:yes'>Carmer, Greg. &quot;Essay 3 Prompt: Elements of\n  Responsible Action.&quot; Wenham, April 2014.<o:p></o:p></span><w:sdtPr></w:sdtPr></p>\n  <p class=MsoBibliography style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;\n  line-height:200%'><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'>—. &quot;Living Responsibly\n  in the World: Notes on Niebuhr&#8217;s The Responsible Self.&quot; Wenham, April\n  2014.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n  <p class=MsoBibliography style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;\n  line-height:200%'><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'>Garber, Steven. <u>The\n  Fabric of Faithfulness: Weaving Together Belief and Behavior</u>.
