These options let me have more desk space, have more ergonomic position, and have a variety of positions I can move into through the day to stay comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>[Sep. 23, 2021 update]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a newer video of my desk setup, highlighting a transition from sitting to walking desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\"  id=\"_ytid_79535\"  width=\"480\" height=\"270\"  data-origwidth=\"480\" data-origheight=\"270\"  data-relstop=\"1\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9-BnvE-Ebo?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=0&#038;cc_lang_pref=&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;\" class=\"__youtube_prefs__  epyt-is-override  no-lazyload\" title=\"YouTube player\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=\"1\" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=\"\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>[Original post continues from here]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am using the extended range Fully by Jarvis frame attached to the desktop I had for my old desk. The extended range allows me to drop down the desk to just above my legs, this makes for a comfortable, ergonomic typing position where my elbows are relaxed at about 90 degrees at my side. The VIVO monitor arms and Amazon Basics laptop mount keep my screens at an easier to use height, with the top of the primary monitor being about eye-level for me, and the laptop mount not only keeping the laptop screen elevated, but also freeing up more desk space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Zhang provided inspiration to me for deciding how to set my desk up.
