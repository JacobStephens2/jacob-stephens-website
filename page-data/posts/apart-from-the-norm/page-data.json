mothers- therefore of every kind of perversion from\nsadism to chastity” (Huxley 39).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is\nwhy the people are discontent, because key things, such as chastity and parents,\nare completely stripped from the people, simply because they can cause\ndiscomfort or sickness. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>These things the\nWorld State forbids are very important, and mustn’t be lost, otherwise one will\nnot find rewarding life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Though one\nwould believe everlasting happiness to be satisfying, if this

the egocentricity of the people of\nthe twentieth century, their ignorance of any reality transcending the self,\ntheir loneliness and despair, and their pointless and sordid existence.”

the people of\nthe World State would be able to find purpose for their lives, because one\ncannot feel that they have truly succeeded or accomplished anything worthwhile\nwhen they are not in control of their life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> \n</span>However, in a society where technology plays such a key role in daily\nlife, people find ways to control everyone else, and that limits how much

technology allows for complete control over\nthe development of people—in the interest of stability.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, controlling the development of\nhumans in such a
