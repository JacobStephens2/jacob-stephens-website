Reconciling scientific and scriptural evidence\nwhich informs this question takes arduous work. I find intellectual laziness a\ntempting response to this question. However, answering it will hopefully draw\nus into awe for our Creator. This debate must not tear us apart from others.\nThe answer is not a matter for dying over life and death. It is not an\nimportant enough question to call for division between those that hold\ndiffering opinions. That said, different scientific beliefs about the answer to\nthis question do lead to different theological conclusions. I believe that God\ncreated the species that live today via evolution. He did this over billions of\nyears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">We cannot observe God. He is\ninvisible. At least, I cannot observe him such that I could study him\nempirically. That does not mean he never manifests himself into our physical\nrealm. To say that he does not manifest himself physically would deny a basic\ntenet of Christianity, that God was <i>incarnated</i>, made into the flesh of\nman. <span class=\"GramE\">Thus</span> God’s supernatural acts are supernatural\nbecause they are not confined to the nearly constant laws of the universe, they\ndo not happen in a predictable fashion, because he controls when they happen,\nand we cannot know for certain what he will do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Genesis 1-2 <i>primarily</i>\ncommunicates truth about God and man’s nature, anthropological and theological\ntruth. Ancient cultures had cosmologies which answer questions about man’s\npurpose, origin, nature, and who to worship. This is the cosmology of the\nHebrews. Genesis was written to the post-slavery in Egypt Hebrews. This\naudience was more concerned with questions that cosmologies answer than\nquestions about physical mechanisms that God used to create. Because the\npurpose of writing Genesis one was to inform the Israelites how live,\napparently living based on the language of this passage leads sufficiently to\nknowing God. Living in such a manner which is consistent with Genesis’s\ndescription of the origin of species with language as simple as “God made the\nbeasts of the earth,” and “the earth brought forth vegetation” is good enough\nto live in truth and holiness. The question of how God must not as important\nfor helping us know how to live and for drawing conclusions about God’s\ncharacter, because it was not included beyond the language that process of him\nvaguely “speaking”, “making” and “letting” things to bring forth life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Secondarily, it communicates what\nhas happened and how that happened, historical and scientific truth. The key\nquestion here is, <i>how </i>did God create species after the first cells? Genesis\n1 reads, “let the earth sprout vegetation…the earth brought forth\nvegetation…let the earth bring forth living creatures&#8230;God made the beasts of\nthe earth according to their kinds” (ESV 1:11-12, 24-25). I interpret the\nphrase “brought forth” to inform the physical origin of creatures upon the\nearth. This makes me think that the earth was such that plants could <span class=\"GramE\">evolve, or</span> be “brought forth” by the earth. This is my\nstrongest scriptural piece of evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Looking at the grammar here\nsupports my point. Creation of species is described in Genesis 1. When we ask\nwho did this, I see two answers. Before the creation of vegetation is described\nin verses 11-12, God says “let the earth sprout vegetation.” Following this,\nthe earth is the subject performing the “bringing forth” action of the creation\nof species, “the earth brought forth vegetation”. In verses 24-25 a similar,\nyet slightly different situation is described for the creation of creatures.\nGod <span class=\"GramE\">says</span> “let the earth bring forth living creatures”,\nand this is followed by “and God made the beasts”. What distinguishes this from\nthe description of the creation of vegetation is the subject doing the\ncreation. In verse 12 the earth brings forth vegetation. In verse 25, God makes\nthe beasts. Looking at these two examples, the earth appears to have a creative\npower <span class=\"GramE\">similar to</span> that which God possesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">God causes natural forces to act.\nAlthough we can’t observe this, we can attribute the cause of rain to God based\non the language in Genesis 2:5, “God had not caused it to rain” implying that\nGod causes rain. This does not mean we cannot understand natural reasons and\nforces that cause rain. But acknowledging God as the one who causes rain is\nwhat I learn from this passage. Also, God has the power to direct trees to spring\nup out of the ground, “out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every\ntree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food” (Gen. 2:9). This does not\ninform how God made the trees spring up, although my instinctual interpretation\nconjures an image in my mind of a tree magically, supernaturally springing\nforth from the ground more quickly than normal. When I step back to think through\nthis, I realize that God could have worked the random element of seed\ndistribution among trees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Phillips (1991) describes the usage\nof the word “day” in the Hebrew language as idiomatic. This is unfamiliar to\nEnglish speakers because we do not have idiomatic expressions for the word day.\nUnderstandably we would misinterpret this as Moses perhaps meaning one day, as\nwe would interpret it. Later, in Genesis 2:4, Moses writes, “These are the\ngenerations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day\nthat the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.” Even here he uses the word idiomatically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">These pieces of evidence, the\nlanguage that is used in Genesis 1-2 does not go against a belief that\nevolution happened. The language for “day” is idiomatic, and in Hebrew is not\nalways used literally. Also, most importantly, Genesis 1-2 was not written to\nprimarily communicate historical or scientific truth. Melding this scriptural\ninterpretation with scientific evidence ultimately leads us into praise of our\nLord because of his incredible ability to create.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There are many pieces of evidence\nwith which science informs us about the natural world. One logical to start\nwith is evidence for the age of the earth. The rise in historical geology <span class=\"GramE\">lead</span> to increased questioning of the age of the earth\n(Wright 64, 2003). People have since struggled with the idea of an old earth,\nbecause it went against typical thinking at that time. However, Augustine\nbelieved in an old earth, and did not have major theological problems with that\nidea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Here is evidence from radiometric\ndating that supports the old age of the earth. Radiometric dating is the idea\nthat from knowing the <span class=\"SpellE\">half lives</span> of various elements,\nespecially Carbon 14, we can determine how old certain materials have been\naround based on their levels of degrading. The legitimacy of this technique is\ncommonly criticized. Claims are made that this method is bunk, and state that\nthe earth simply <i>appears</i> to be old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Radiometrically dating\nPotassium-argon leads to a conclusion that the earth is 3.6 +/- 0.05 billion\nyears old (Wiens 10, 2002). This range comes from possible errors that are <span class=\"GramE\">taken into account</span>. This has a <span class=\"SpellE\">half life</span>\nof 1.26 billion years. This date, 3.6 billion years is the time that the\nelement was formed from lava. The atoms do not leave the original location once\nthe magma has hardened. The number of parent atoms (potassium-40) are measured,\nas well as the number of daughter atoms (argon-40). Then the ratio between the\ntwo is calculated to determine the length of time that they have been\ndecomposing. The following equation is used to calculate the <span class=\"SpellE\">half life</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;\ntext-indent:.25in;line-height:200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:\nnone;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">t =\nh x <span class=\"GramE\">ln[</span>1 + (argon-40)/(0.112 x (potassium-40))]/ln(2)<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;line-height:200%;mso-pagination:\nnone;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Using this, scientists calculate that this rock must\nbe 3.6 +/- 0.05 billion years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Antagonists of evolution argue\nagainst it by describing its unlikelihood. It is still possible despite <span class=\"SpellE\"><span class=\"GramE\">it’s</span></span> unlikelihood. A claim of low\nchance is often made against evolution, stating that the process of <span class=\"SpellE\"><span class=\"GramE\">a</span></span> organism becoming more complex\nis too unlikely. However, if God puppeteers the randomness, he could have\norchestrated the world to come into being the way it is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">An alternative approach to this\nproblem is to say that God is big enough to use whatever the world became for\nhis purposes. The prevalence of “he made” language in Genesis 1-2, makes me\nthink that he had a more direct influence over the course of its development\nthan simply thinking that he allowed it to evolve on its own and then made use\nof whatever resulted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:200%;\nmso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">There is no difference between\nmicro and macroevolution, this supports evolution.

These basic physical features that all organisms have\nin common—nucleic acid to carry information, the ability to reproduce, cells,\nplasma membranes, the ability to metabolize energy, protein. Every single\nliving organism contains nucleic <span class=\"GramE\">acid, and</span> thinking\nthat all species have the same ancestor. This makes me feel a closer connection\nto organisms of the earth, to think that I have the same physical ancestor as\nthey do. It draws me to want to care for them more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Although there may not be a problem\nwith an old earth, people have posed theological complications stemming from\nevolution—that because death existed and was used to form man, there is a\nproblem with a shift at some point from survival of the fittest to let’s love\nand have equality type morality. However, this could have changed when God\nbreathed his Spirit into a hominid form to create the first humans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">In Genesis 1-2 God mandated man to\nhave dominion over the creatures of the earth, to care for them. If thinking\nthat all living species were created via evolution, and are thus connected to a\ncommon ancestor, that makes me feel more connected to the organisms of the\nearth, and thus builds up in me a desire to care for them. This seems to me a\nvery beneficial result of believing in evolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Thinking that God created an earth\nwhich is governed by physical laws such that a process as intricate as\nevolution draws me to worship him. If he <span class=\"GramE\">has the ability to</span>\ndo that, I am given a greater sense for how awe-inspiringly brilliant he is.\nHumans cannot not draw forth into imagination a natural system as detailed as\nthe one God has made, let alone drawing forth that system into existence.\nMeditating on the grandeur of the natural history of species draws me to awe\nover God because I attribute creation of the system to Him. I am satisfied\ndeeply by attributing the creation of a smart system to him. Part of the beauty\nof evolution is that we can comprehend it. We can imagine what happened\nphysically over the last hundreds of millions of years for the diversity now\npresent on the earth to come forth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">I want to incorporate evidence\nabout the world from Christianity as well as science <span class=\"GramE\">in order\nto</span> frame my beliefs and worldview. I choose to do this by thinking about\nhow different studies inform what I believe differently. As I’m trying to look\nfor the answer as to <i>how</i> God created species, Genesis 1-2 <span class=\"GramE\">do</span> not bear much on my scientific understanding of the\nphysical answer to this question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-indent:.25in;line-height:\n200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The nature of science comes down to\nbeliefs while the nature of Christianity comes down to belief as well. No\namount of evidence can prove that something is true, but we can choose to\nbelieve that things are true. However, the idea is looming in my mind which\nsays that we can definitively know the truth. Science does not lead to these\nconclusions. The Holy Spirit may move to reveal to someone truth about\nsomething. Belief in Christ in the first place is a choice that we make, or is\nit a gift which is given to us? If it is a gift, there are multiple ways of\nknowing, unless God is somehow involved in securing our decisions to believe\ncertain things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:Cambria;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-ansi-language:\nEN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\"><br clear=\"all\" style=\"page-break-before:always\">\n</span>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;text-align:center;\nline-height:200%;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:\nnone\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">References<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-right:-.5in;line-height:200%;mso-pagination:\nnone;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. 2011.\nCrossway, Wheaton, IL. 1664pp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.5in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%;\nmso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Phillips, P.G. 1991. “Are the Days\nof Genesis Longer Than 24 Hours?
