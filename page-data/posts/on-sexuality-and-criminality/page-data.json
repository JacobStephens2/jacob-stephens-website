Michel\nFoucault wrote many genealogies of the present, which explain how history\nbrought things to be the way they are in the present. As a result, the\nhistorical subjects he chose related to pressing concerns of his time.

There are a few thinkers who I will examine in order to open new\nquestions related to crime. I will present some theory from Michel Foucault,\nJudith Butler, and Linda Zerilli. My task is to track their discussion on the\nparticular phenomenon of sexuality, and in the course of presenting their\nthoughts on this topic, I hope to illuminate their distinct theoretical\nperspectives. Then, I will move into the second major section of the paper,\nwhere I aim to develop a similar conversation around the phenomenon of\ncriminality, in other words, criminal behavior and incarceration. I will start\nwith Foucault&#8217;s understanding of incarceration and policing. Following that I\nwill present some of Judith Butler&#8217;s thoughts on criminology, and I will also\ntake some of her theory from the prior <span class=GramE>section, and</span>\nuse it to analyze and examine crime. Finally, because I have not sought work of\nLinda Zerilli&#8217;s on incarceration (if any exists, I am not sure), I will take\nher theory, and use it to examine crime. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;\nline-height:200%'>In the course of creating a conversation, my hope is that I\ncan open up new questions about incarceration, and that then I can take those\nquestions into my exploration of how I understand and respond to kids who break\nthe law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc450769487\">Conversation on sexuality</a></h2>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>These\nauthors swirl around a number of topics that they relate to sexuality:\nsubjectivity, sex categories, power, feminism, sexuality, identity, discourse,\nlanguage, plurality, political ramifications, gender, and freedom.

He in the end theorizes that the desire for power to\nget people to talk about sexuality is that it can be measured, and, as I take\nan interpretation from James Taylor, the soul is where the body and the way of\na person meet, and so if one understands the soul, then one can control and\ntransform a group of people. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>Â </span></b><span class=GramE>So</span> this is what\npower does.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;\nline-height:200%'>Foucault moves into talking about the creation of\n&quot;sex&quot; as a term and with its meaning that goes beyond the standard\nways of being.

He examines the social phenomenon of sexuality and\nthe increased discourse and the increase amount that people talk about it. He\nexplains why it is there by saying that it is a function of power, a power that\ntries to get people to be understood, as the title explains, the will to\nknowledge.

The prisons system\nis not very visible to the majority of people in the France of the 70s, and\nstill today in the United States. This work involved interviewing prisoners,\nfamilies, and examining the ways that prisons worked.

This work eventually culminated in the book, Discipline and Punish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span>Foucault published Discipline and\nPunish: The Birth of the Prison in 1975. In this text he goes through the\nhistory of how we got to have our contemporary prison system. The system we\nhave today is different than the system that we had for dealing with criminals\n1000 years ago. The system then was more about capital punishment, and about\ninflicting physical pain, and often execution on the subject. Or on the person\nwho was transgressing the law. But now, in the contemporary time, or rather,\nover history, there was a shift, especially starting in the 18th century. Where\nthere was a group of people who were punishing, and they started to lean\ntowards rehabilitative types of punishment and eventually leading up to the\ncontemporary prison system. These systems began to <span class=GramE>encouraging</span>\nvarious behaviors, this power, that is. Talking about power is very important\nfor Foucault. And in this text, he disciplines himself to talk about power as\nnot emanating from a particular subject, but instead as something which acts\nand moves separately from just individuals. Sciences that sought to measure\npeople&#8217;s movements were part of these new systems. This was discipline. <span\nclass=GramE>So</span> the power was making effort to create various behaviors,\nnot only to repress them, as many people understand power in a flawed way,\naccording to Foucault. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span>Foucault suggests that the modern\ncarceral system was completed with the functioning of a particular school in\nthe mid 19th century France.

A person does not become a criminal until they either\nconfess to an authority that they broke the law, which rarely happens in\ncomparison to the amount that people get caught doing something <span\nclass=GramE>wrong, and</span> are then labeled as criminals. They become\ncriminals, and that identity seems to go beyond just a label that is used to\ndescribe them. It is an identity that seems to be given. If someone becomes a\ncriminal not only in label, but in identity (created by the incarceration and\nlaw enforcement systems), then Discipline and <span class=SpellE>Punish&#8217;s</span>\nthesis that the carceral system pushes and creates crime seems to be confirmed.\nI would not have considered this so much though without the way that Butler had\npointed out the construction of identity according to power.

She seeks to do a genealogical\ncritique, which she understands like Foucault as the founder of, and she\nunderstands this critique as looking not for the origin of gender and desire,\nbut as searching for the political effect and use of gender. And <span\nclass=GramE>so</span> in the same way, we can consider, what are the political\neffect of labeling people prisoners? Michelle Alexander, in the New Jim Crow:\nIncarceration in an age of Colorblindness, wrote that parolees are not allowed\nto vote. People labeled criminals do not need to be appealed to by people\nrunning for various governmental positions that require election. That is to\nthe advantage of people looking to maintain the prison system. If those in\nprison could vote, that would lead to a much greater <span class=GramE>amount</span>\nof votes for political candidates who are going to work to shorten the votes of\nthe people who are incarcerated or still in very surveilled statuses, such as\nprobationers an parolees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span>For power and categorization, there\nis an effect here of the person having their identity built by the power.

The prison examines nearly every movement of the person. There is the\nallowing them out to shower which is facilitated by a guard. That is tight\nsurveillance. How much freedom do they have in this intensely viewed and\nwatched system? It seems small. Though they still have the option to follow\norders or not. They have the ability to comply with the program or not.\nhowever, if they want to leave, they only have one option, and that&#8217;s to\ncomply. They must conform their behavior to the behavior that is required by\nthe institution. And in this way, we are seeing that power cultivates\nparticular behaviors, not only represses some behaviors. The behaviors here\nthat are being cultivated are regularity, discipline, an ordered life, and the\nprison institution is seeking to transform these people into a particular way\nthat can be used to maximize the life of the system that is creating them.\nZerilli may push back and suggest that there are more options to them than\nsimply conform to be created in the behaviors that the institution is pushing\nto give to these people.

Foucault suggested that sexuality was a\ndiscourse that was caused by power, in order that power might maximize the\nproductivity of populations. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>Â </span>Butler\nquestioned the category of women as a comprehensive <span class=GramE>group,\nand</span> recognized the difference present within that group. Zerilli picked\nup on the political ramifications of problematizing women as a coherent,\nunified group. She suggested then an alternative political way which is\ncharacterized not by a pursuit of the good of a particular group, but instead\nshe defined feminism as the pursuit of freedom, and she accepted Arendt&#8217;s\ndescription of freedom as political action rather than as theory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span>I then imagined what the arc might\nlook like on the topic of criminality. Foucault starts with his actually\nwritten Discipline and Punish, suggesting that the prison system creates\ncriminals. I imagine that Butler would go on to say that criminals as a\ncoherent group is a problematic category. Furthermore, Zerilli&#8217;s idea of a\npolitics that fights for freedom instead of a particular group is more\npowerful, and that idea can be applied to political projects that move in the\nname of criminals. The goal there is for them to be freed and treated well, but\ninstead, Zerilli&#8217;s idea calls me to think that a political project pursuing freedom\ngenerally is better, and a political project that conceives of freedom as\npolitical action, rather than as theory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span>Some of the new questions that this\nopens up are the following: What sort of effect does constitution as a criminal\nhave on a person? What does power have to do with the creation of a criminal? What\ndownfalls exist to a political project seeking the good of prisoners? Such as\nthe project that Foucault worked on, PIG? How might Zerilli be wrong about\nsuggesting that politics in the name of a group might be bad?<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>Â  </span>Is the category of criminal, or incarcerated\na coherent group? How has the category criminal been constructed? What\nramifications does our conception of incarceration have on our response to it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc450769496\">Bibliography</a></h2>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;\nmargin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:\n12.0pt'>Alexander, Michelle. 2010.

Gender Trouble. 131. Here is the contrast that Butler points out, which\nis between Foucault&#8217;s repression of emancipatory discourse in History of\nSexuality, and his indulgence in that discourse in the introduction to\nHerculine Barbin. &quot;The sexual world in which Herculine resides, according\nto Foucault, is one in which bodily pleasures do not immediately signify\n&quot;sex&quot; as their primary cause and ultimate meaning; it is a world, he\nclaims, in which &#8216;grins hung about without the cat&#8217; (xiii). Indeed these are\npleasures that clearly transcend the regulation imposed upon them, and here we\nsee Foucault&#8217;s sentimental indulgence in the very emancipatory discourse his\nanalysis in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The History of Sexuality</i>\nwas mean to displace.&quot;</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style='mso-element:endnote' id=edn17>\n\n<p class=MsoEndnoteText><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn17' href=\"#_ednref17\"\nname=\"_edn17\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:\nfootnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span\nstyle='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-ansi-language:\nEN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[17]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nZerilli. 2009.
