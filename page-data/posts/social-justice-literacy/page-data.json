This concept is a paramount\ngoal that most societies strive for. The term is one that has been constantly\nshaped and re-shaped by culture, history, and time. In her article <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>More Than Words? Delving into the\nSubstantive Meaning(s) of “Social Justice” in Education</i>, Corrine E.

This variance\nstems from the wide range of perspectives that are shaped by the unique life\nexperiences of each individual. While the range of perspectives on social\njustice is important in order for a society to progress, they can also be a\nsource of tension. When theories on social justice clash, activists are capable\nof unintentionally perpetuating the very thing they desire to end: injustice.\nIn order to alleviate this dilemma a new methodology needs to be used when\ndiscussing social justice; one that allows citizens to become aware of the\nrange of understandings that catalyze diverse social justice theories. Being\nexposed to a variety of perspectives not only allows one to think critically\nabout the implications of their own perspective but also that of others. These\ninsights provide a holistic framework from which we can approach social justice\nthat can progress towards achieving this common goal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoCommentText style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;\nline-height:200%;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'><span style='mso-tab-count:\n1'>            </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Justice\nInterruptus</i> author Nancy Fraser examines the changes in social justice\ntheory through historical and cultural lenses. According to Fraser, social\nactivism in the nineteenth and twentieth century was centered on “socialist\npolitical imaginary”.<sup> 2</sup> Renowned theorists such as Karl Marx argued\nthat the disparate distribution of material goods amongst people in society\nshould be considered the prominent social justice issue of the era.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During this time, “economically defined\nclasses struggling to defend their interests through ending economic\nexploitation and gaining equal redistribution” catalyzed social justice\nmovements. <sup>2</sup> Yet, as the twentieth century progressed, the focal\npoint of social justice movements shifted. Rather than emphasizing material\ninequality, social justice theories highlighted the inequality of social\ncapital. Social justice movements were marked by culturally defined groups\n“struggling to defend their identities” through ending cultural domination and\ngaining cultural recognition in exchange. Fraser termed this shift in theory\n“the post socialist condition.” She observes while modern social justice\nmovements lack in clear trajectory, there remains a proliferation of causes\njoining the front. The cultural politics of recognition are eclipsing the\nsocial politics of redistribution causing a “decentering of claims for equality\nin the face of aggressive marketization and sharply rising material inequality”.\n<sup>2<o:p></o:p></sup></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>North expands on\nFraser’s model of social justice by highlighting two other frictions that are\nembedded within her discussions. She identifies one as “differential emphases\non equality as difference and equality as sameness”. <sup>1</sup> The “equality\nas sameness” perspective assumes that all people are the same and should\ntherefore be treated as such. On the other hand, equality of difference argues\nthat human beings are inherently different. Proponents of this perspective\nbelieve it’s important to acknowledge that not all people are starting at the\nsame place socioeconomically, due to historic oppression. The concept of\n“sameness” implies the existence of a particular standard. Usually that\nstandard mirrors the identity of those who’ve inherently had the most opportunity\nand power within in a society. “Equality of Difference” supporters contend that\nnot acknowledging difference amongst people inevitably compromises minority\ngroups within society because the standard of “sameness” forces them to not\nacknowledge the relationship between the unique history of their particular\nidentity in the United States with their with their current life circumstances.\nNot acknowledging relationship can often leave them feeling deficient and\ndisempowered. Equality of difference assumes that all people are different and\nshould therefore be equally validated, affirmed, and respected for being as\nsuch. The second tension she addresses is the varying attention to justice in\nmacro-level processes such as educational policy making and social movement\norganizing versus micro-level processes, which emphasize individual behaviors\nand daily social interactions. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype\n id=\"_x0000_t75\"

Today, there is a “language of social justice.” Words\nlike classism, gentrification, sexism, systems of oppression, etc. all make up\na vocabulary created by diverse theories of social justice. However, not\neveryone has access to this vocabulary, creating barriers in dialogue about the\nvery injustice they are subjected to or perpetuating. Fraser pushes for a new\napproach to achieving social justice, one that seeks to broaden knowledge on\nthe topic rather than limiting it. Through valuing different social justice theories,\nthis methodology promotes the truism of perspectives on social justice being as\ndiverse as the people who are entitled to it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> \n</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At\na Christian institution like Gordon College being “literate” in social justice\nis important for a number of reasons. One being social justice is Biblically\nmandated. In his book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Generous Justice</i>,\npastor Tim Keller asserts, “The Hebrew word for “justice,”&nbsp;<i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mishpat</i>,&nbsp;occurs in its various\nforms more than 200 times in the Hebrew Old Testament”.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to Keller, the basic meaning of\nthis word is to treat people equitably. Misphat could manifest in acquitting\npeople for wrong-doing according on the merits of the case; however it also\nmeans giving people their rights. Deuteronomy 18 directs that the priests of\nthe tabernacle should be supported by a certain percentage of the people’s\nincome. This support is described as “the priests’&nbsp;<i>mishpat</i>,” which\nmeans their due or their right.<i>&nbsp;</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nitalic'> Keller connects that verse to our current society through explicating\nits importance in general terms. <i>Misphat </i>is giving people what they are\ndue, whether punishment protection or care. If you look at every place the word\nis used in the old testament it is used in conjunction with several classes of\npeople: “Widows, orphans, immigrants, and the poor” In pre-modern agrarian\nsocieties these groups had no social or economic power. Today the quartet could\nbe compared to other vulnerable groups within our society such as refugees,\nracial minorities, those who are without homes, single parents, the elderly,\netc. The misphat or justness of a society within the Bible was evaluated based\non the treatment of these groups. In Matthew 25:45 Jesus states, “whatever you\ndid not do for one of the least of these, you did not for me.’ God loves and\ndefends those with the least economic and social power and therefore so should\nhis children. </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>From the beginning\nof the Bible to the end God continually calls humanity to act justly towards\none another. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In\ncalling humankind to act justly, God desires that his followers address\ndifferent types of injustice in the world. In the book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>Forgive Us: Confessions of a Compromised Faith, </i>Reverend Jim Wallis\ncritiques the common Christian understanding of sin by illuminating that it\nresides on societal levels beyond that of the‘the individual’. According to\nWallis, “If we are to mirror the new life that is the resurrection, dying\nprecedes rising. Repentance and forgiveness precede reconciliation. The\nbiblical term for repentance is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>metanoia</i>,\nwhich means to ‘turn around and go in a new direction’” (Wallis 17,18).<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order to do so Wallis insists that\nChristians must die to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> types of\nsins. While addressing our personal sins is important, our sinning doesn’t stop\nthere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“We must acknowledge our\ncomplicity or entanglement in systems and patterns of sin and injustice.” The\npattern of the world is explicitly and implicitly tainted with injustice.\nInjustice doesn’t just manifest in the actions that take place on an\ninterpersonal level but they also exist within the “pattern” or the cultural\nnorms of our society. Social structures shape the actions and behaviors of\nindividuals within a society. They have the ability to privilege certain\nindividuals at the expense limiting the opportunities of others. Though Genesis\n1:27 states, “<span style='mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\ncolor:#001320;background:#FDFEFF'>God created mankind in His own image…male and\nfemale he created them”, sinful structures in our society attempt to dismantle\nthis truism through valuing different identities over others. Wallis calls\nChristians to reflect on the social implications of their identities and how\nthey play a role in perpetuating systematic oppression or what he would term\n‘structural sin’. By not examining taken for granted presuppositions,\nChristians could unintentionally hurt their neighbors through participating in\nthese systems. </span>“When we fail to take seriously enough what our tribe has\ndone to others, what it’s implications have been and are, and what steps are\nnecessary to bring about reconciliation been and are, we undermine the gospel\nwe proclaim” (Wallis 18). <span style='mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Today\nwe are face with the reality of American society becoming increasingly\npluralistic. Cultural pluralism is the “concept that individual ethnic groups\nhave a right to exist on their own terms within the larger society while\nretaining their unique cultural heritages” <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>SOURCE?</b>.\nOne of the many goals of social justice is to promote diversity through\nrespecting and embracing the differences of individuals within society.\nHowever, respecting others can be a challenge if individuals are uniformed on\nwhy they are different from their peers. In Mark 12:30-31, Jesus calls His\nfollowers to Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul\nand with all your mind and with all your strength.’&nbsp;The second is this:\n‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.”\nYet, the task of loving our neighbor also requires a broader understanding of\ntheir identity and how it’s impacted by greater society. The heavenly vision\nportrayed in Revelations 7:9 describes Heaven in the following way, “There before\nme was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation tribe,\npeople and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb.” God\nuniquely handcrafted each individual on this earth. When humanity is united\nwith their Lord they will not be transformed in a way in which they will all\nlook the same; rather they will be equally celebrated for what makes them\ndifferent. Therefore Christians should begin that process ‘on earth as it is in\nHeaven’ through exposing themselves to the differences of their neighbor and\nchallenging themselves to respect and eventually celebrate what makes them\ndifferent. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally,\nsocial justice literacy is important because it addresses issues regarding intent\nof individuals with power and influence vs. the actual effect of their work.\nOften leaders have the intent to promote justice in their spheres of influence;\nhowever, when they have a limited understanding of social justice, the justice\nthey envision has the ability to do more harm than good. In Steven Corbett and\nBrian Fikkert’s book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>When Helping Hurts</i>,\nhe claims that one of the main goals of the ‘<a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commission\" title=\"Great Commission\"><span\nstyle='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Great\nCommission</span></a>’&nbsp;is to help the poor and the desolate. Yet, the two\nassert that the definition of poverty will change depending on who is defining\nit; the poor defining it through the psychological and social scope while\nwealthy churches contribute it to the lack of material things or a geographical\nlocation. The authors emphasize that this can cause a harmful cycle where North\nAmerican churches provide material resources and evangelism to the poor, which\nreinforces the poor people&#8217;s sense of inferiority and lack of self-esteem,\nwhich in turn increases the original problem. Though individuals may intend to\nhelp in the best way they know how, if they are unaware of broader\nconceptualizations of what justice looks like their impact could be\ncounterintuitive. When it comes to people’s lives and identities, the impact of\nour actions can be profound and wide reaching and that’s far more important\nthan the question of our intent. We need to ask ourselves what might be or\nmight have been the impact of our actions or words. It is vital for individuals\nto step back and listen when we are being told that the impact of our actions\nis out of line with our intents or our perceptions of self.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='color:black'>Our challenge is a lack of education.

Touching upon the major religions in the world – Christianity,\nJudaism, Hinduism, and Islam – understanding their worldviews and principles\nwill help one to understand social justice in a more comprehensive way and vice\nversa.
