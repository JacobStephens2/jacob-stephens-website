goals</b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I worked with\nPartners in Development, Inc. (PID) for ten weeks. Patrick Magennis, the field\ndirector, served as my supervisor ([email, phone]). His boss’s name is Julie\nDillard, the US Program Director, who through the summer I phone called about\nsome decision-making ([email, phone]). She also prepared me for and debriefed\nmy trip. Concerning townspeople, I assisted a local coordinate the kids summer\nprogram; her name is Shirley Hodges ([email, phone]). In addition to interning\nwith PID I volunteered at the Greenwood Leflore Hospital, based in a city 26\nmiles from what became my hometown in MS. My primary contact at the hospital is\nGwen Neal, the volunteer coordinator ([email, phone]).</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Following are 5 general\nobjectives I made for the summer, as well as assessments of my success at completing\neach. 1: Learn about southern culture, underserved areas in the US, and explore\nconversation on illiteracy and healthcare in the MS delta. The culture I\nlearned the most about is impoverished, rural, African American southern\nculture. I did not search through journals to explore conversation on\nilliteracy or healthcare, but I did learn about it via other means\n(conversation with and observation of locals, including medical professionals, volunteers,\nall manners of residents from the town I lived in, as well as a teacher from a\nnearby school. I also learned from Patrick). 2: Perform duties PID gives me\nwith rationality and responsibility. Overall I met this objective well, but I\nmade mistakes. One of them was giving pay to someone to hand off to another\nperson. 3: Have fun with townspeople the way they have fun. A few basketball\ngames with teens of the town, playing with kids, hanging out in the clubs, a\nhouse party, and dominos met this objective. 4: Focus my career path by\ndetermining where and in what field I want to work. I am now open to living in\nmore places than I was before, so in a sense I failed this objective, because I\nam now open to living in more places. I want to go into sociology research with\npotential to guide decision making. 5: Discover what parts of the summer work I\nliked most and least. I especially liked dealing face to face with\ninterpersonal problems. Imagine an upset 23 year old woman, “That bitch better\nknow what’s coming to her!” tears stream down her face. <span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>“It’s alright, Jackie. What happened?” This\nwas a situation I didn’t mind being in. I disliked fixing problems which\nresulted from poor filing of sponsorship forms.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Following are 8\nmeasurable goals and corresponding evaluations. 1: Type an articulate, 10 page\nresearch paper on public health in Glendora. Check, asides for the articulate\nbit. 2: Read one book biweekly related to factors that contribute to health\nproblems in the MS Delta. I read a book or article almost every week, and although\neach reading was connected to health, not each reading was connected to medical\nhealth, which is what I intended by this goal. 3: Work with PID to develop\nuseful questions, then interview at least 74 town members (50%) I <span\nclass=SpellE>inteviewed</span> only two people, and made the questions without\nPID’s help. 4: Find and train at least one person to take over my position as a\nvolunteer leading fitness training. By the end of the summer Patrick and I found\npeople in a town 10 miles north who began to lead exercises. 5: Gather a group\nof at least 10 individuals to go to the health conference, then have at least 3\nof those individuals keep up to date on what they were taught at the\nconference. Success. 6: Eat dinner weekly with someone or a family from the\ntown. This I did not do well on. I found ways to eat with people, but they were\nnot sit down dinners like I had anticipated. 7: Visit four government offices\nwho govern this town. I visited two government offices. 8: Volunteer at\nTallahatchie General Hospital at least 1 day per week. I spent at least six\nhours at the hospital nearly weekly either volunteering or shadowing.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:\nnormal'>What I did for PID in the MS Delta: Who I was with, responsibilities,\nand activities</b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I was with people\nin the MS Delta. I lived in an apartment with the field director. Our apartment\nwas public housing in the “roughest” part of the little 150 person town. My\nneighbors became a daily part of my life. Who were they? People shocking to\nmiddle class propriety: people who love to drink, their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>lingua franca</i> is expletives, sleeping around is healthy, they’re\ndefensive to fight on <span class=SpellE>facebook</span>, habitual to attend\nchurch, make recreation out of sitting on their front porch, laughing through\neverybody’s blinded windows, make nourishment out of frozen meat and lasagna, give\ntheir kids snack bags of chips, and make high priority out of family reunions. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>My\nresponsibilities morphed throughout the summer. The reason for this is partly\nbecause this is a program that PID is just starting up. Some of the thought\nbehind our work was, “try lots of things, many things will fail, but eventually\nwe’ll find something that works.” I began with responsibilities that included\ntransporting people to get help with their health. A county wide challenge was\nstarted by a doctor in public health who lived in a town 30 minutes drive away.\nPID expected me to come into helping get people involved in that. I was to take\npeople and tell them about this, persuade them to come to the registration day,\nand then urge them to continue coming to the workshops that happened weekly. I\ntransported people to these workshops. I also held some responsibility to\ncommunicate with people about when workouts and exercises were happening.\nPatrick would daily during the workweek set up times in the afternoon to lead\nexercises from people in this town, so we would walk along the broken up, dry,\nwhitewashed gray jeans pavement from our apartments the 100 feet it took to\nreach what used to be the town clinic where we usually held aerobic and\nstrength oriented exercises. In the beginning of the summer I simply did the\nworkout as Patrick led, and in the middle I was leading it with him, then at\nthe end I was leading exercises independently. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another large\nresponsibility was managing the kids summer program. The kids summer program\ninvolved a person from town who coordinated the work of a few others from town.\nShe got them scheduled and working various hours that were needed. I discussed\nthe formation of this with Patrick and this woman, Shirley, and then began the\nprogram 3 weeks into my being there. Early in the program I made sure Shirley\nhad the supplies she needed, and then I tracked the hours people worked, and\ndid their pay roll. When Shirley had problems with her employees, such as one\nnot coming in when she said she would, usually she talked with me about it.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>For PID I was\ninvolved in a range of activities: running in the mornings, which is tied to PID\nwork because it demonstrated a lifestyle we hoped townspeople aspired to. Yoga\npractice became regular in the second half of the summer. I constructed\nplayground equipment. I lead teams of people who came to visit on mission trips\nor service trips. Patrick and I did this regularly in order to try and develop\nsome sort of program which could have been used with people in the town. I\ndrove people to their license tests and permit tests. I taught people to drive,\nwhich meant letting them drive my car and telling them what to do. I quizzed\npeople on driving rules and regulations. I instructed people to take tests in\nthe computer lab. I transported people: this manifested itself in taking town\nteens to basketball practices or teen nights at the community center in the\nnext town over. I went to two town hall meetings, and at each PID was on the\nagenda, although neither featured me as the mouthpiece. I discussed nutritious\neating as well as sexuality with the townspeople. Debates about fidelity vs.\npromiscuity were common. I walked with <span class=SpellE>townsmembers</span>\nas exercise. I interviewed two people about their situation, thoughts, desires,\nand beliefs.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:\nnormal'>Worldview, drugs good of order, and creational norms encountered in MS\nDelta community development<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The overarching\nworldview in Glendora and the surrounding towns seemed to worshipping status. I\ndub this statusism, or, as HanByul Chang phrased it, a “respect-centric”\nworldview. Although there is materialism mixed into this life as well, I am\ngoing to focus on this obsession with others’ opinion of one’s self. Statusism\nplaces its hope into having respect as being the key to a satisfactory life,\nsaying implicitly, “If only I achieve the respect of everybody, then there will\nbe nothing greater I can achieve.” It views others who are working to destroy\none’s own built up status as a threat. It celebrates those who come in and help\nit achieve greater status (such as my coming in and nearly giving people the\nability to legally drive). <span class=SpellE>Respectocentricity</span> cannot\ntolerate looking silly or undignified. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What did I do in\ncontrast to this worldview? I made myself look silly. In late June it rained so\nheavily that the grass in front of the apartments’ parking lot flooded. Patrick\nand I were in our house aware of what happened, but then we joked about going\nout and splashing around in it. Our eyes caught fire, spread wide open, jaws\nopened a bit, and soon we were both running back to our rooms and changing. We\nran out into it, and were the only ones splashing around. The picture on the\ncover of this paper is of this day. Our neighbor snapped the photo of us using\nher phone. No other adults or even teenagers joined us. The oldest was a\nperhaps 12 year old boy. People came out of their houses and children ran into\nthe water to join us. Adults looked, the women smiled and laughed, so did the\nteens, but the older men looked on in seriousness, yet some made lighthearted\njokes about us.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What does\nstatusism sound like? It is a dull tone of voice in teens who don’t smile much,\nexcept when their guard is let down. When I looked across town and waved at\nsomeone, the response did not involve smiling or waving, rather a flat stare\nand a few fingers popping up in acknowledgment. I’m guessing they would not\nwant to appear silly by being overenthusiastic.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As a result of their\nholding personal respect in such high value I ended up witnessing two town\nfights. Statusizers hold their self-perception to the town in such high\nstandards that if someone from the outside comes in and critiques their status,\neven if it is on Facebook they will come derisively back at the people who\nissued that derogatory remark. One woman, 28, who seems younger because of her immaturity\nto initiate fights on Facebook (by wiring them with comments others bitches for\nthe way they dress and who they slept around with. I saw her run after another\nwoman with a white pipe in her hands. Before she could swing at the woman her\npartner ran out and withheld her. On the other side of the parking lot was\nanother drama breaking out. This was between a butch girl, her female lover\n(highly looked down upon in this town, behind homosexuals’ backs they are\ncalled fags) who were holding hands. They needed to demonstrate their resolute\nstrength in order to gain respect. Her 60 year old grandmother was running out\nwith a bat; I’m not sure who this anger was directed at. Likewise she needed to\nput action to her smack talk to gain the respect of others, so then perhaps\nthey could be scared of her even. Luckily an gold toothed ex-prisoner of the\ntown came and withheld her. He eventually brought her into her house, but\nfinally she came quickly stumbling out, and he followed with a torn wife beater.\nHe appeared to be the hero in this situation, although the cops initially\nbrought him over for questioning, not her.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I experienced a\nwoman crying tears of anger in front of me after I told her that she couldn’t\nwork anymore. The decision had filtered down from her supervisor, Shirley, and\nshe kept going on and on about how she was going to slash Shirley’s tires, and\nthat “she doesn’t know who she’s messing with”. She was explicitly upset about\nnot knowing why Shirley didn’t tell her herself. I wonder if part of her fear\nwas a result of being scared of other people finding out that Shirley didn’t\nwant her to work for her (because of bipolar disorder and yelling at kids\nunnecessarily), and as a result of this knowledge spreading they would lose\nrespect for her.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What particular\ngoods are provided by the town? Plenty of drugs are present. One of my\nneighbors named Pound, nearly every time I walked by he mysteriously, magically\npulled a bottle of vodka out of his pocket, pressed it into my chest, and with\na sly smile, “Jacob, for you.” Every time I’d laugh a bit, “Pound, I’m sorry, I\ndon’t need that right now. My contract… I’m going to do yoga. I need all the\ncoordination I can get.” On another occasion he made a joke about a\npsychedelic, I disclosed my too experienced past, and he said, again with a\nCheshire smile, “I’ve got everything you can imagine in there… acid, shrooms,\ne—you know what that is?” “<span class=SpellE>Haha</span>, yes Pound, and I\ndon’t want anything. Thank you though. You’re a generous man.” Perhaps telling\nhim that was a bit too generous. There is plenty of financial motivation in the\ntown.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How did these\nparticular goods recur? I never uncovered the sources of these drugs, although\nI’d imagine some of the moving happens within the clubs. There is a man in town\nnamed Leon, who is on the board of aldermen, and owns and runs the biggest club\nin town. Patrick suspects that he must be a large mover of drugs, he is also\none of the town’s greatest sources of income. He hosts yearly a\nstripper-dominant freaknik in the town park.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What coordination\nof human operations enables the cycling of weed? Pound is one of the players,\nmoving drugs on the ground to consumers. Leon provides the venue for the\ntransactions between dealers closer to the growers themselves and dealers who\nspread the product to consumers. The consumers smoking it is an essential part\nof the process.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Where are the habits:\nvolitional, cognitive, and skill-based? Some people need to be willing to take\nthe risk of getting caught by cops. They need the cognitive ability to deal\nwith money and numbers, well enough to make some profit: this is not required.\nSkills required are rolling blunts and keeping things secret as they’re being\npassed along.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>An institution\npresent is the morning bowl of weed. This smoke is more common than a bowl of\ncereal. Many people smoke regularly. Hot boxing is a common way of passing\ntime.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The personal\nstatus of Leon matches up with his power. He has the habits required to coordinate\nthe flow of drugs into a town, so for his skills, he is in a good position. He\nis on the forefront of town politics as an alderman, which gives him some of\nthe knowledge he might need to make good decisions. Pound is in an appropriate\nposition as a ground level distributor, because he is friendly and persuasive,\nyet he is baked too much to have a good handle on the bigger picture situation\ntype business thoughts one might need to overview a drug syndicate.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The good of order\nsurrounding drug flow affect the families who live in the town. There is\nevidence of creational norms in that there are family units in the town. The\nnorm is a man and a woman as the mother and father of the family, which seems\nbased in Genesis 2, God’s creating a “helper” who was suitable for man. This\nnorm is broken by the majority of families with children who live together\nlacking a father—evidence of the Fall. God seems to have intended for children\nto be raised with a mother and father (extrapolating from Genesis 2), so when\nthere is only one parent, something goes wrong. Some evidence of the pain of\nthis results in the children being attention starved. Patrick and I would walk\naround town and frequently end up with a swarm of children accompanying us to\nwherever we go. Whatever work we did on the playground amassed children. The\nnorm is for a family to be together, and for the parents to be loving and\nsupportive of their children. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;tab-stops:45.0pt 49.5pt'><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>There is evidence for the fall in community\ndevelopment in that it is addressing problems of the fall. It also seizes\nopportunities, but it also deals with problems, such as division between groups\nof people. When there is racism, community development could meet that need by\ncreating a program which brings people together, or creates a program in which\nthey gradually work more and more together. When workers who are working\ntogether in community development have divisions marked by vice, that is\nevidence of the fall.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%;tab-stops:45.0pt 49.5pt'><b\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>What I learned about myself: I enjoy\nexploring problems of social science while immersed in an impoverished context</b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>First I will\ndiscuss what made the context I was living in enjoyable, and second, I will go\nover what sort of problems I felt the greatest magnetic attraction towards. The\ndiscussion of what made living there enjoyable will be short, and sprinkled\nthrough the section on what problems I was interested in will be sprinkled\nthings that repulsed me.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Community\ndevelopment involves working with people in many economic strata, and the\ntarget population I focused on was poor. As a result many live in dilapidated\nhousing. By sleeping all summer on an air mattress in a bug-infested room, I\nrealized I have the ability to live contentedly in an impoverished area. I even\nenjoyed living in similar shelter because it led to greater understanding of\nthe population I was working with. When people complained of $300 per month\nelectricity bills, I could explain how we achieved a light bill of $50. When we\nput in a work order and it took a month for the service man to come fix it, we\ncould empathize with our neighbors, and know that this was not a problem they\nwere stretching the truth for.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Trusting\nrelationships must be built with a community before beneficial interactions\nbetween stranger and local can begin. I am talented at developing trusting\nrelationships with people, even if they were raised in drastically different situations\nthan mine. I found this through the ease at which I could approach and chat\nwith people. I saw this trust developing ability in myself not only through\nlooking at my own actions, but also through looking at the responses of others.\nAfter a month, my neighbors trusted me to drive them around the county, and\nthey comfortably invited me into their homes.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I enjoyed the\nchallenge of coming to see lacks in the MS governing code. Many people in\nGlendora are behind on child support. One of these men I talked with and\nlearned that his driver’s license was suspended as a result. I called the DMV\nand read the codes online to find out that in MS, there is no driver’s license exception\nfor people who are behind on child support. That is, there is no way for\nsomeone who is behind to get a license. In NY there is an exception: those who\nhave a job can acquire a limited license, which allows them travel to and fro\nwork. Why this difference? I don’t know, but seeing a problem like this\nfascinated and excited me; it seemed like something I could pursue, and\neventually make tangible progress, perhaps even resulting in a change in the\nlaw.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I became\nfrustrated when people did not show up to scheduled plans. This aggravated me\nmore than anything else because of the disappointment I felt in reaction to it\nhappening over and over again. For example, I scheduled appointments with an\nold man; he wanted to learn how to read the alphabet. On the first occasion he\narrived on time, but for subsequent appointments he did not show up. By the end\nof the summer I learned to discern whether people’s yeses were sincere or not. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I found myself\nmore interested in content than the processes. Working to understand the\npopulations and problems excited me more than doing the activities set to\nalleviate the population’s problems. I wanted to gain insight into why people\nlived the way they did. Why did so many apartments look like their decorations\nwere from the 80’s? Why were there so many family portraits? Why were there so\nmany fabric wall decorations? The conversations in the car with people who I\ntransported were more interesting to me than the transporting itself. Although\nI was more interested in their beliefs than in the material provision of their\ncircumstance, however, Paul Farmer’s study on voodoo belief’s correspondence\nwith improving from TB sickness concludes that there is almost zero correlation\n<w:Sdt Citation=\"t\" ID=\"-1770382780\"><!--[if supportFields]><span\n style='mso-element:field-begin'></span>CITATION Tra09 \\p 34 \\l 1033 <span\n style='mso-element:field-separator'></span><![endif]--><span style='mso-no-proof:\n yes'>(Kidder 34)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]--></w:Sdt>.\nWhat they believed seemed to have very little influence on whether their\nphysical health improved from TB or not.

Learning how language worked\nfascinated and caught me off guard. I was uncomfortable about using swear words\nat first, but then became comfortable with it for the sake of speaking the same\nlanguage as the people. My motivation to curse with them was to connect more\ndeeply. I wanted to develop close relationships so that others felt comfortable\nasking me for favors that would result in self-betterment, such as getting a\ntrip to the DMV.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A new interest of\nmine is in law. A new care is about the motivation of people to better\nthemselves. A new concern is city governments, or more specifically, mayors\npocketing money they receive from grants. A new question is how do I get people\nto care about new things? (This question was given to me last semester in\nclass, and it had specific variants through the summer, such as getting people\nto care about having a license, or giving them the motivation to help work on a\nproject that would better the whole town, such as a playground.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I can imagine\ncontinuing work in that area—geographically and the type of work I was doing,\nalthough raising kids in that environment would be very difficult, because they\nwouldn’t have the friends in town I would want them to have. They would likely\nsmoke weed at some point out of peer pressure. Ideally my wife would be\ninterested in the same population, and be concerned about the good of the town\nas well. I would want to do better research and writing—more consistent, daily\neven. Mine was sporadic, and I never revised it, had it edited, or shared it. I\nwas scared to because it did not meet my standards for excellence. I found it\npoorly organized and worded.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>To better match\none of my extroverted gifts, woo as Strengths Quest describes it, one of my\nresponsibilities could have involved going around the next town over and\nexplaining what PID could do for those who were interested. If I had been\nassigned the task of interviewing I could have done that well, although a\nweakness of mine would make this challenging: my inconsistency in starting\nactions early, and my lack of persistent follow through on a project. Having\nthis be an assigned task though would have put greater pressure onto me for\ndoing it, and early on I could have set a timeline of required milestones.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A rewarding\nelement of my work that could be transferred easily to another setting is the\nprogram development that I had to do for the kids program. I felt like more of\na liaison though, and I did not come up with any of the core philosophies or\neven details of how things would be run, I shared ideas between people: Patrick\nsuggested a morning/evening twice a day structure, Julie directed us to create\nthis program because she suspected that kids might not be getting enough food\nto eat. I stepped into this project with some of it already formed though. I\nhad to respond to what bits of the project had already been set. I received the\nimperative to continue the project that had been started. Shirley, once I\nshared with her Patrick’s suggested structure, revised it to include all ages\nmorning and evening, rather than <span class=SpellE>youngin’s</span> in the\nmorning and <span class=SpellE>oldin’s</span> in the afternoon. I said sounds\ngreat, as much of my strategy in talking with her was to ask what she wanted to\ndo. I wanted her to have more ownership of this program than I did; I just\nwanted to facilitate her thinking through everything, and help provide her with\nthe resources she needed to put flesh to her ideas. I really enjoyed this, and\nalthough I could have very easily come up with the ideas for how to do things,\nand in response Shirley likely would have taken my ideas, I provoked her to\ncome up with the ideas on her own.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I would like to\ncontinue to explore community development because it seems like a niche type of\nwork that I can do well that is important. It is niche in that it is not\nentirely common amongst towns to have people working solely on community\ndevelopment. Even if it is not a full time job of mine I still want to somehow\nbe working on the projects that are happening in my town. It is important\nbecause there are changes happening as a result of this work like the stemming\nof educational programs that previously did not exist, or the cooperation of\npeople into community effort groups that are working on volunteer projects.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The challenge that\nexcites me most about this field is developing people to care about things that\nare greater than themselves and their town concerns. If someone would eat\nhealthy, so their grandchild could have a healthy grandparent, I would be\nastonished and in great admiration. An opportunity that I see in the field is\nto get people to trust others more. This caused a number of problems, from\nlower quality of overall town service of maintenance to individuals not\ntrusting others with their children.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In conclusion, I\nlearned what life is like in a poor area of the MS Delta.
