In the second half of this <span class=GramE>essay</span>\nI lay out why I’m interested in this field, how I can employ my strengths (one\nof which is learning), to serve DHC, and lastly some next steps of action I\nplan on taking, including applying to work at Vanguard summer 2016, and\nfocusing my academic efforts 2015-2016 on preparing for that new setting.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:115%;\nmso-outline-level:1'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Section One: Development of Human Capital in\nthe Delaware Valley<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>What is human capital (HC)? HC is\nthe collection of habits, knowledge, skills, and connections a group of people\npossess which can function towards creating economic value. Putting human\ncapital in contrast with human resources (HR), we see that HR focuses on what\npersonnel are available to an organization, human capital focuses on what\nskills, knowledge, and experience are possessed by a group of people, whether\nthat group of people belong to a region, organization, or country. Development\nof human capital (DHC) is distinct from education. DHC centers on the growth of\na group’s skills, knowledge, and experience which functions towards producing\nvalue, while education (in a narrow sense), is instruction between teacher and\nstudent to the end of developing some desired quality in the student. Education\nmay be used in the process of DHC. But other factors contribute to DHC as well,\nincluding elementary schooling, cultural understandings of child rearing,\nspiritual realities, laws, and a host of other factors. To state that the human\ncapital of an area is developing is to assert that the people of that area are as\na whole growing in their ability to produce economic value, which could mean\nany of a wide variety of qualities are improving in that people group. HC\ngrowth in an area may mean that a greater percentage of the people in that\nregion have the habit of self-advertising than in the past. Self-advertising\ncontributes to the formation of economic value because it is a skill vital in\nacquiring employment. Some of the <span class=GramE>places</span> advancement\nof HC takes place are in schools, on the job, and in other educational programs.\nThrough refining in this area, people acquire the knowledge, skills, and\nwillingness necessary to perform key operations in the economy <span\nclass=GramE>in order to</span> produce economic value.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:115%'>We will focus on\nhuman capital development in the Delaware Valley (DV). The Delaware Valley is\nthe region surrounding Philadelphia with about a <span class=GramE>40 mile</span>\nradius, containing parts of PA, NJ, MD, and DE. Counties include Philadelphia,\nBerks, Camden, Chester, Cecil, and others (see figure 1).</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center

Perhaps an adult who grew up in\nReading missed out on their education as a child due to some corrupted family\nsystem, where the child’s parents don’t support the child’s education.

A chef instructor at a culinary arts institute teaches other people how to\nprepare food in a way that makes the food worth more. A life coach who gets to\nknow someone may find out the individual in focus may have a habit of talking\nin a disrespectful way to their teachers. The life coach is then free to bring\nthis problem to the student’s attention <span class=GramE>in an effort to</span>\ninstill an attitude of respect in the student. The unemployment rate of the\nDelaware Valley is decreasing, which is movement in the direction of victory\nfor the kingdom of light (see figure 2)!</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center

The person\nwho grew up in that environment has the capacity to go and become\nself-sufficient, but they do not know that lifestyle because they have never\nseen it.

Many students come in dependent\non public assistance, but after graduation 81 percent become placed in the food\nservice industry, and thus begin contributing to the economic prosperity of the\nDelaware Valley.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Candace Matthews-Bass of the\nPhilabundance Community Kitchen helped found their job training and life skills\nprogram, and presently works as the director of this program. She is committed\nto giving people second chances to become self sufficient. She works in service\nof this mission by guiding the direction of the PCK program, meaning that she\nhas coordinated the program’s location changes. She has regular face to face\ncontact teaching the students math, developing their ability to run things like\ncash registers or do math for converting the measurements in recipes.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Another organization, Eastern\nUniversity, a Christian liberal arts university based in Delaware county, develops\nstudents’ leadership qualities in a way that allows them to provide better\ngoods and services to not only the Delaware Valley (DV), but to the world. One\nneed of the Delaware Valley community is wise, convicted leadership, and\nEastern produces conviction in their graduates over years of teaching by people\nwho already have conviction about acting with the goal of realizing what is\ngood. By having students think through difficult issues, and putting them into\npositions of leadership, they <span class=GramE>have the opportunity to</span>\ndevelop their leadership skills.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Eastern University is devoted to\ninstilling a commitment to justice, Christ, and the common good in their\nstudents. They have a program for their students called the Leadership Fellows\nprogram which teaches students about <span class=GramE>leadership, and</span>\nrequires greater involvement in leadership positions at their college and in\ntheir communities. Leadership is a less tangible skill than knife cuts, so it\ncan be more difficult to develop in students, but it is needed in the people of\nthe DV.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Now we’ll imagine a change to the\nDV public school system that could be done to improve HC. Changes to the public\nschool system that reflect the effective principles of PCK could help the DV\nboost their people’s skills and character. Economic value is produced by the\nneeds of the community – people pay for work that they need and value, so a\nhelpful question inquires into the needs DV has for its human capital. What\nqualities and abilities does DV need in its working population? The DV needs\npeople with bodies and minds able enough to work to have the qualities they\nneed to be employable. Ideally, every graduate from high school in this region\nwould be employable, but many people either drop out, or graduate high school\nstill not employable. They still may not have adequate math skills to run a\ncash register. <span class=GramE>So</span> some change in the education system\ncould be made by adding effective principles from PCK.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:115%;\nmso-outline-level:1'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Section two: <span class=GramE>Myself</span>\nin response to what’s going on<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:\nnormal'>Why <span class=GramE>I am</span> interested? How <span class=GramE>I\ncan</span> employ my strengths in service of this concern?<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>The core reason I feel called to\nDHC is because of my commitment to Christ. He values DHC as a good activity in\nthe world, secondary to that are the particulars of my strengths and history\nthat contribute to my suitedness for a career in this area. Me moving into DHC\nin the DV is a good choice.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>There are <span class=GramE>a\nnumber of</span> ways my worldview has implications for understanding my\nvocation to DHC. I will mention a few key reasons. To begin with, all are\ncalled. I know I am called to work. Second, all positions are of interest to\nand in service to God. Some are in more right-relationship with <span\nclass=GramE>him</span> and some are more distorted. Developing a region’s job\nskills, in whatever form that comes, is a position of interest to and in\nservice to God. Third, God calls us to reform and challenge fallen structures.\nIn seeing the <span class=GramE>way</span> the public school system produces in\npeople a lack of the skills they need to contribute to the economy, arising out\nof that reality is a call to reform and challenge that fallen structure of\neducation, because it is currently moving in the direction of the death of\npeople’s contribution, rather than towards vivid, living, valuable additions to\nthe DV society. The needs of the the DV community give rise to the value of\nhelping people become better ready to work. The community needs job ready\npeople, so the work to reinforces employability gives it value. Work can be\nunderstood as co-creation with God. God is working to develop people to take\nhold for the next generation and to keep the world going, and part of that is\ndeveloping the attributes people need to meet the needs of the community, and\nso we co-labor with him in meeting the need for improving people.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>God calls us to make good <span\nclass=GramE>decisions, and</span> gives us freedom to make these choices. We\nsee in Solomon’s prayer a request God for understanding to better judge and\nrule the people. However, God also calls through extraordinary experiences, as\nwe see in Moses’ hearing a voice out of a burning bush. However, I have not had\nany extraordinary experiences from God.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>How have I come to take these <span\nclass=GramE>particular challenges</span> as my own? I have discerned that it\nwill be a good decision and good course of work for me, as I have some gifts\nand abilities necessary, and have been acted on in particular ways that make\nhuman capital development a good choice where I can effectively impact this\narea of life.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>In the past I have acquired jobs\nwhere developing people was an important skill required for doing the job well,\nwhich makes me suited for moving into DHC. I have been accepted to become\nresident advisor (RA), and therefore judged to be a good RA, which is a\nposition where one needs to hold a group to a particular standard <span\nclass=GramE>in an effort to</span> shape them to the vision Gordon College has\nfor them. That was 2013-2014. For the summer of 2014 Partners in Development (PID)\naccepted my application to become a field intern, which was partly due to the\nrecommendation I had from Laura Carmer (a co-director of an honors program I\nparticipated in, which was focused on vocation) who told me and told PID that I\nhave a strong ability to develop trust in new relationships. Part of that\nquality comes out of my aptitude for <span class=GramE>opening up</span> and\nletting people into my life and struggles.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>I can employ my strength in\nlearning to identify new negative trends in HC. I have a talent in learning new\npieces of knowledge and new things that people are teaching me, or new skills,\nwhich can assist in more effectively enabling other people to become productive\nworkers- by Over the years I have developed this talent of mine into a\nstrength. Learning is important for developing an aptitude for the things that\none needs to know to teach people the skills they’ll need to succeed for the\nworkforce. The knowledge needed to contribute changes over time, and those\ntrends must be learned by the teacher before they can be shared with the\nstudent. But also, learning what the problems that people developing work\nskills are encountering could prove a helpful skill in figuring out what to\nrespond to. The Kingdom looks to have people ready to do excellent work, and\nthat means being aware of and ready for changes that are coming or happening <span\nclass=GramE>in the area of</span> work. The fall leads to ignorance, a lack of\nthe knowledge necessary to do various things.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>My work habits are characterized by\nmy appreciation for drawing up a detailed plan of action, and then getting the\nsupport of my co-workers in carrying out the endeavor. I can employ this habit\nto come up with a plan for subverting the environments that malnourish people\nof work models and instead giving them models they can strive to become like,\nthen get the support of a team of people to execute that plan. This summer I\ncarried out an independent study in the process of my own learning and\ndevelopment, and one part of it was a challenges and opportunities essay, which\nfocused on current problems that PCK was facing. I had to gather the support of\nmy team in watching my presentation on the report and in giving me feedback and\nevaluation of the report and my presentation, but once I did, the work I did\nended up contributing to some of my coworkers who were looking for research on\nworkforce development and community kitchens. There I drew up a plan of action\nto develop a response to the problem facing <span class=GramE>PCK, and</span>\ngained the support of my co-workers in executing that plan.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>I can employ my strength for\nthinking about things to develop ideas about how to effectively develop HC. I’m\nalso talented when it comes to thinking about things, I love to think about\nthings, and even in writing this paper, I’m excited to develop my ideas about\nwhat I’m called to and about what’s going on in building strategic value of\nlaborers. I enjoy long periods of time alone to research this topic of building\nvalue in a group of people and how to do that. I am developing focus and thus\nturning this talent into a strength by managing my time. One effect of the fall\ninto human capital development is the distortion of peoples’ ideas of what the\nactual problem is. The real problem is sometimes very difficult to discern, and\nthere may be many distorted ideas about what the actual problem that is holding\npeople back, or there may be ideas that are distorted about what people need <span\nclass=GramE>in order to</span> develop. Someone may think that making it\nregular to let people slide on their program requirements may be an appropriate\nresponse to their status as people who are not actually as capable as others.\nHowever, is that really, <span class=GramE>actually an</span> effective way to\ndevelop people into what they need to be to contribute to the needs of communities?\nPerhaps a better way is to believe the best of <span class=GramE>people, and</span>\nbelieve that people who grew up in a project are just as capable as those who\ngrew up in an ivy-leager’s home. Determining the <span class=GramE>actually\nmore</span> effective way requires careful thought and research.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>My strength of learning can be used\nto cultivate human capital by learning the ways that people best learn. And\nthen to apply that into the way that a company develops their people. <span\nclass=GramE>So</span> if I am working at a large investment management company,\nthey’ll have a human resources department, like Vanguard. Vanguard has a human\nresources department, and part of it is dedicated to teaching their people and\nimproving them. The actions of Vanguard’s HR department in turn affects the DV,\nbut only a small part of it. Why is learning so critical for teaching? Because\npeople go to teachers for new and good information, and the process of learning\ngathers new information and refines old information.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>I’m a person of integrity, which is\na gift that God has given me, and I want to use that to steward the human\ncapital of God’s good creation – the way human capital and stewarding with\nintegrity relate is that I’m going to examine the way that people are being\ntaught, and work to the end that they are working to have integrity as well.\nAnd <span class=GramE>also</span> I want to keep an eye out for what people are\nbeing taught to do and think, cause some beliefs that are taught can be harmful\nto people, such as teaching a view towards work that workers do it only to\nprovide for themselves, omitting any sense of consideration about how their\nwork contributes to the common good.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>A gift I have been given is my\nhistory of experience in education, which helps expand my vision for how people\ncan be cultivated through education. I have been acted upon in such a way that\nit became very easy for me to go to a Christian liberal arts college, which is\na unique philosophy of education, and very well rounded. And <span class=GramE>so</span>\nwith this vision I have for education as formation, as I have seen and\nexperienced at Gordon College, I have the potential to become someone who can develop\npeople into a vision that contributes to their formation beyond professional\nskills, but that contributes to their intellectual maturity, which is required\nfor certain jobs. A job where you’re governing <span class=GramE>people, and</span>\ndetermining what they can and can’t do is going to require some thoughtful\nconsideration, as to benefit the people and not harm them. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>How is human capital a resource to\nbe stewarded? With the joy I take in thinking about things, I could consider\nwhat it means to steward people that you’ve been entrusted with and what it\nmeans to develop their capacities to contribute. Looking at a business from the\nprinting world, Masthof press, we see some of the structure of a manager is to\nsteward their employees, and in that <span class=GramE>structure</span> there\nis direction towards life that is characterized by respect, honor,\nappreciation, grace, and consolation. When an employee is highly helpful to the\norganization, the manager may celebrate them by rewarding them with a bonus.\nJust to appreciate and bring together his employees, the owner of Masthof this\nsummer brought everyone and their families to a buffet at Shady Maple\nSmorgasborg in <span class=GramE>Lancaster county</span>. <span class=GramE>So</span>\nin my strength of developing ideas by thinking about them, or by research, I\ncould develop the understanding and knowledge I need to effectively develop\nhuman capital if I’m in a manager or ownership type position.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:\nnormal'>Outline of the next steps I can take to address this concern<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Currently, I do not have skills\nnecessary to move into a position where I will be significantly contributing to\nanyone’s development, and I have strong desire to develop very tangible skills\nand expertise that can be used to effectively complete a specific task. Gordon\nCollege will help develop me into a person who is distinguished by intellectual\nmaturity and Christian character, which will give me soft skills to be\neffective in addition to my hard skills, but also then I could have a bigger\npicture about the significance of my work, and where I’m going, and where I\nwant to push the industry towards, with an ethical framework for making good\ndecisions. I want to memorize information that is required for my job. I have\nthe idea that understanding lots of information is an important part of the\nbottom or the actual product producing people of any position, and how could I\nmanage without that knowledge? I could manage without the expertise of producing\nthe product, I think, so long as I understand the objectives and can delegate.\nHowever, I could not evaluate what is excellent quite as well without the\nexpertise of producing the product in question. However, I do have the capacity\nto work in ways that help people develop personality traits that will help\nthem. I could go back into work with an organization like PCK, where I am in a\nsmall way contributing to the functioning of the overall program, which helps\ntheir core area of activity, which is developing students. However, I would not\nbe the one shaping the program or working directly with the students.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>I could work with The Vanguard\nGroup <span class=GramE>in an effort to</span> develop my understanding of\nbusiness and investing, which I could then use to move into a position where\nI’m developing other people&#8217;s investing knowledge with that information, and\nthereby increasing their ability to produce worthwhile things for a geography. The\nVanguard Group has a few positions that I qualify for and could apply in\nSeptember 2015 for a position summer 2016, and these positions would help me to\ncultivate business acumen helpful for developing people in the DV. This would\nallow me to move more effectively into a role where business knowledge is\nrequired, so the position would look more like program and business development\n(with human capital development as a concern). An option down the road would be\nto try and move into HR with Vanguard to be taking part in the ways that\nthey’re forming their employees. A problem I currently have is that I don’t\nhave any skills that are particularly expert type skills. Currently, as of\nSeptember 9<sup>th</sup>, 2015, I can make an application to Vanguard for their\nClient Relationship Specialist position, which functions as an entry level position.\nAnother position at Vanguard is as a Developer, who would help test products,\nand I would learn to develop software. There’s the Vanguard Accelerated\nDevelopment Project program (VADP). The College to Corporate Internship (C2C)\n–Business. Acceleration into Financial Professional Program (AFP). Technology\nleadership program. Administrative Assistant. Entry Level Developer. That’s\nwhat I can do now <span class=GramE>in order to</span> apply for a position\nnext summer. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Another route I could take is\nbeginning a Master’s in counseling fall 2017, perhaps even at Eastern\nUniversity, which would assist me in my personal, face to face development of\nhuman capital, because through learning about counseling I would gain knowledge\nof how people’s psychology of development works. If I want to develop a program\nor business with a strong human capital development component, business and psychology\nknowledge could be very helpful. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>This coming year, my final year as\na <span class=GramE>full time</span> undergraduate student of Gordon College,\nmajoring in sociology, I can focus on learning what Gordon and sociology have\nfor me, and how they apply to developing human capital, and how they apply to\nmy work this coming summer. Gordon strives to graduate students distinguished\nby intellectual maturity and Christian character. It would benefit me and my\nwork to ask how those qualities manifest themselves in investment management. One\nthing that could help me do this is write a two-page paper from each class\nconnecting the ideas of that class to the work that I plan to entering this\ncoming summer, particularly Vanguard. That is the direction I am going to move\ntowards initially, which means eventually learning business concepts and money\nmanagement concepts, which is a skill I could bring to any position after doing\nthis job. I’ll focus on learning the Series 7 General Securities Representative\ninformation next summer, hopefully on the job at Vanguard, and then I could\nwork for a year and a half at Vanguard, marry Kendel Lyn, and be free to either\ncontinue work with Vanguard or move into work or study elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>I will also be focusing on peace\nand conflict as a part of my study at the Balkans, which can lead to insight\nthat could be applicable for moving into work with an organization, because\nthere may come up tensions between me and co-workers, and then I could step up\nabove and beyond my duties to fulfill that requirement. I would keep my eye out\nfor that. And I could also keep my eye out for that sort of thing during my\nspring semester at Gordon college.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>I won’t always be able to predict\nhow my information might relate to my upcoming job, but I could develop a contact\nin the organization I plan on working for who would help me figure out how the\ninformation I learn could relate to my work with them. Maybe they’d be willing\nto talk once a month or so over the coming year, and during those times I could\nbrainstorm about how what I have been learning could connect to my job, but <span\nclass=GramE>also</span> I could brainstorm about how what I will be studying\ncan be directed to think about relation to my upcoming job. After this job I\ncould move into assisting nearly any organization invest, and therefore create\nvalue for them. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>I could also learn more about\nVanguard by making a regular discipline of studying content explicitly required\nand related to the work I’ll do next summer, like details of the company and\nknowledge I’ll need to do good work for them. This might take the form of every\nSaturday morning I take an hour to research information related to the job I’ll\nbe doing. I could do work on attaining my General Securities Representative\nQualification. Perhaps that would be unnecessary and my energy would instead be\nbetter focused on other things.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'><span class=GramE>In order to</span>\nfigure out a good use of my career preparation study time I could talk with\npeople at Vanguard to focus that time, or whatever organization I end up\nworking for or moving towards. Perhaps there are people there interested in\ndeveloping new employees that would be willing to talk with someone who is\ngoing to work there. It would be a unique relationship. The relationship would\nturn into a mentor type relationship, and perhaps I could even in the end find\nsomeone who somehow moved from the position I’m interested in to either a\nmanagement position, HR position, or conflict resolution spot. Maybe there’s\neven someone with a Christian worldview I could look up to, like Jeremy Kinsey or\nDave Mcnamara (who I’ll discuss later). There’s also the person who I met at\nVanguard EXPLORE day, his name is Nojan Zomorrodian, and he liked the questions\nI was asking, so he gave me his email address.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4'\nhref=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;\nmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:\nminor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\nmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:\nEN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[4]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>James Taylor will be a good person\nto talk to because of the way he’ll be able to help me imagine how my peace and\nconflict studies might help me serve financial services.

His\ndoctoral thesis is on a revision to one of Kierkegaard’s ideas.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>In the spring, Dr. J would be a\ngood person to follow up with and connect with about zeroing in on my\nunderstanding of <span class=GramE>sociology, and</span> imagining how that\nmight aid my work in financial services. I have a history with him as well, and\nso he’d be a good contact to go forward with, especially to have a professor\nwho has seen real growth in my academic abilities. That would be very good. He\nhad me for 2014 fall and 2015 spring, and in the 2015 spring him and I had a 1\non 1 guided study, where we met a few times a week to go through the\nfoundational thinkers in sociological thought. Sociology focuses on groups of\npeople, and the way that their history of choice and apprehension affects life\nand circumstances. Financial services provide help to groups of people with\ntheir money, so some sociological understanding of what peoples’ understanding\nof finance is like could help <span class=GramE>penetrate into</span> giving\nthem better advice as I walk them through various deals on the phone. And\nultimately having that business knowledge would help me develop programs or\npeople to have more profit producing proficiency.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Jeremy Kinsey and Dave MacNamara\nare Vanguard employees and members of the Hopewell Network, which is the\norganization that my home, local church, Hopewell Christian Fellowship (HCF)\nsubscribes to. Perhaps I could even have a conversation with one of them every\nother month updating where I’m at with school and then even brainstorming about\nhow what I’ve learned connects to preparation for working in financial\nservices, and then making some goals with them about what I could do in the\nfuture with them. Developing a relationship with them would first involve\ntalking to them about their willingness to make the time for a regular\nconversation. I could do that this coming Sunday at Hopewell, Sunday September\n13<sup>th</sup>. Furthermore, I could use them as contacts in my application to\nVanguard. Jeremy told me to use him as a reference on my application, though I\nhave not met Dave yet. Jeremy was also wondering what questions I had about\nworking there, and I asked about hiring, and he said they do already have some\ninterns from this past summer hired for next summer.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'>Pastor Mark Kraybill of HCF is very\nsupportive and interested in what the young adults of Hopewell are doing, and\nhim and I have a good relationship from working together on leading the young <span\nclass=GramE>adults</span> group in summer 2015.
