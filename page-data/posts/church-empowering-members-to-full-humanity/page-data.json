God made humans,\nand thus knows how they live best. His will for people is for them to live in\ncomplete joy (John 15:11 NIV). He loves to work with them, to see them develop,\nwork, care, and love. He mandated that they have name things in the world, and\nthat they cultivate the garden. He has set out a mighty mission for humans, and\nhas written a story of grandeur around them. People from all over should see\nthose living a life in obedience to their creator and drop their jaws in\nresponse. Christian life has brought forth some of the most amazing art humans\nhave known—the Sistine Chapel, and incredible movements in justice—Martin\nLuther King Jr., and astonishing lives of compassion and integrity—think of\nMother Theresa and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. People across all faiths admire and\naspire to lead similarly great lives, not necessarily of fame, but of meaning\nand significance.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Churches\nof New England may stunt believers’ work in the world to solely theological\ntasks, or tasks of service in the church. The church I grew up in did not\nencourage me to go out and make astonishing music, unless witnessing to God’s\ngospel was the ultimate aim of my endeavor. I find this bringing the quality of\nthe work down a notch, because the ultimate aim of good work is not simply an\nexcellent product or service, but to spread the gospel. I find the reverse\nvaluation a more fruitful way of thinking and acting. When excellent work is\nthe aim, and then people inquire about one’s beliefs and motivation, realize\nthey are a Christian, and as a result are very winsomely attracted to this true\nand powerful vision of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Part\nof this vision includes a manner of responding to the world with a few vague\ncategories of action: play, learning, work, and rest (Marshall). I will center\non play, and how the church can encourage its members to realize how this fits\ninto the life Christians are called to. Then they don’t fall into the draining\nstate of becoming guilty after every portion of time not spent working.\nAccording to Marshall, we also have certain tasks in the world, such as\nimagining and creating beautiful material in the world, such as homes and\nclothing (155). He focuses on art, politics, the natural world, and technology.\nThese are not the only tasks given to us by God. I will center on how the\nchurch can support it’s members to embody God’s desire for art in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A misconception of\nGod’s intent for humans can devalue certain kinds of work in the world. Beliefs\nfor what God’s will for man is dictates the way man values different types of\nactivities. In medieval Europe, a common belief was that God willed for man to\ncontemplate more than he willed man to create images (Hardy). These beliefs\ndenied the human body as a hinderance, which resulted in people devaluing many of\nGod’s structures, such as finding agricultural work less Godly than\ncontemplation. The source for the idea which idealized the separation between\nmind and body came into Christianity by influence of Platonism (Gonzalez). Physical\nlabor and even the work of statesmen became less worthwhile than more ethereal\nactivities, like prayer, singing, and meditation. The dominant belief in\nmedieval Europe was that the work of mind and spirit was God’s desire for man.\nGod willed that men contemplate more than he willed for them to create\npaintings or play chess. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Luther dedicated\nhis life to what he believed God’s will for him was, which at first, was that\nthe most God ordained work he could do was that of a monk. However, this work\ndid not lead to his flourishing, rather, it lead to his discouragement. His\nsoul was brought to depression as he climbed up and down the stairs, saying a\nhail Mary at each step, becoming frustrated by his hopeless view of achieving\nholiness enough to allow for salvation (Hardy). Amidst his toil and devotion, God\nrevealed to Luther the doctrine of grace—part of which is God’s will for man to\nnot strive for his own salvation. He stumbled upon this through teaching on\nRomans, finally he came upon a passage which struck him in a light it never had\nbefore. Luther’s story illustrates the difference in one’s life living\naccording to the true will of God for our lives. At times we deceive ourselves\ninto believing certain things, like listening only to Christian music, are the\nwill of God, but in the end, these false beliefs lead to a strain on our life.\nThese false beliefs discourage vibrancy of life.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I\ngleaned a stifling false belief from the church I grew up in&#8211;work involving\nexplicity Christian ministry is God’s ultimate will for us. To illustrate this\nexample in an extreme fashion, if we could all live perfectly according to\nGod’s will, we would all be missionaries, pastors, and running homeless\nprograms. If the church, the body of Christ, celebrates accomplishments from a\nbreadth of careers, people would realize that Christ also celebrates\naccomplishments in a diversity of types of work. This true, altered belief\nleads to human flourishing, because people stop beating themselves up over not\ndoing “Christian” work.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At\nThe Harbor, a church in Beverly, MA, a woman, who we will call Lisa, went\nthrough the training school offered by the church, which focuses on providing\npeople with training to become a missionary in another country, especially\nfocused on church planting. After graduation, Lisa, with her graduating class,\nwas applauded by the church. They stood on stage and smiled. Within the last\nfew weeks, she decided to move to India for three years. As a reward for this\ncommitment, the head pastor had her stand in front of the congregation to\nexplain what and why she was doing. Then the pastor, alluding to the applause\nof angels in heaven, called for the church to give a standing ovation to her.\nThis was the longest applause I have heard at the Harbor for months.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>No\none working or making accomplishments or commitments to other types of work\nhave been brought before the congregation. Given, the Harbor ran this\neducational program. Institutions celebrate their alumni more than other\ninstitutions, but the nature of a church is a gathering place for a widespread\ngroup of people. A worshipping community involves people of all professions and\nstrains of work. The body of Christ has many parts, which leaves room for\nbiophysicists, physicians, cell phone salesmen, students, seminarians, burger\nflippers, house cleaners, actuaries, enlisted privates, and gymnists (1 Cor.\n12:12 NIV). These are some of the jobs at the Harbor.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>If the cell phone salesmen\nwere brought before the church and applauded for making record sales, the\nchurch would be left working harder no matter their work. The church would live\nmore fully because of freedom from the lie that God desires pastoral ministry\nmore than graphic design. Church members would no longer feel guilty about not\ndoing the work that they don’t do. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The\nfeeling of inadequacy is a negative, distorted view of people’s self identity,\nthe structure of self esteem set in the wrong direction.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Because\nthere is a proper structure of adequacy, we ought to feel inadequate when we do\nnot live up to the way God has willed us to live. A problem with a worshipping\ncommunity celebrating only missions work is that it leaves some not in missions\nwith a misconception that their work is not as valued by their work community,\nand thus less important. This could leave a feeling of inadequacy, or of\ndissapointment in one’s self, which is not God’s will. He does not intend for\nus to live in self pity when we are actually doing something good and\nimportant, like selling cell phones.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Growing\nup I saw my youth Pastor Derek up on the stage. I saw him as the model for a\nmature Christian. What I missed however, was the separation between his full\ntime profession and the part of his person that defined his Christianity. Then\nI thought I needed to be able to speak a well articulated sermon and lead\nsessions of praise and worship in order to be a mature Christian. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The\nthought which says I need to do what a pastor does to be a Christian does\nappear widespread through Gordon. At least, that feeling is not commonly\ndiscussed, but perhaps many people believe this and do not say it. I imagine\nthat many people in church, when presented with the idea that pastoral and\nmissions work is greater, more sacrificial work which pleases God, would likely\ndeny that statement. The idea that if everyone became a foreign missionary the\nworld could not function, seems common, and that the body of Christ is\nwidespread and requires people who are doing many things, seems normal. However,\nto reinforce the fact that the missionary’s work is not more important than the\nsalesman’s, people could be put on stage and celebrated for many different\ntypes of work and accomplishments. During times of announcement we could\napplaude a great diversity of work publicly. If I had seen those people and\nfeats on stage growing up, instead of just my pastors and worship leaders. I\nwouldn’t have developed an all-hail-the-missionary complex. My motivation for choosing\nto puruse medicine would not have been, “I would not make a gifted pastor, so\nmedicine seems like the next most Christian type work I could do well.”</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Connected\nto teaching Christianity such that God’s will for people to do ALL sorts of\nwork, is the idea that play is an important part of the Christian life as well.\nSenior year of high school I found myself drained by my difficulty in\nhabituating the ideal of making every conversation explicitly about God. I\nasked why play, why board games, why movies were important? What gave <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pointless</i> video games (as I saw) a\npoint? I needed an end to justify spending time doing these things without\nguilt. When my friends responded with “because it is important.” I was not\nsatisfied. Why? No scriptural backing. I saw no benefit in play. I felt guilty\npartaking of it—as if I wasted my time. So I strove to play less, and in return\nwork and learn more, but I became drained. I didn’t like who I was becoming.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Churches can help\nmembers understand play more deeply by hosting playful events. Marshall\ndescribed a scenario in which a group of Christians came into a bar, started\ndancing, and eventually had business men taking a break there dancing in a\nconga line (111). No body knew they were Christians until they were asked who\nthey were. The following day one of the band members became a Christian, and\nthe people in the bar that night had their perspective on Christians reoriented\nfor the rest of their life, making Christians more winsome missionaries\n(Blanchard). I could have learned a lot about Christian life from teachings on\nChristianity that explained why play is an important part of Christian life.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In class, we\ndiscussed an hypothetical example of HanByul taking on a multimonth long work\nproject. Throughout this period she does not take time to rest or play. Her\nfriends shock her by telling her that they don’t like who she is becoming. Now\nshe smiles less, and the corners of her mouth are slightly downturned. India\ndescribed her incredibly work heavy time at Princeton as something which turned\nher into a robot—implying that she was not living in the fullness of humanity\nwhich she could have been.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Worshipping communities\nought to host events purely for fun, without a primary purpose of evangelizing,\nbut simply to enjoy life. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>“Play is what\nwe do for no reason at all. Play is not done for any reason outside of itself.\nIt is done for its own sake” (Marshall 108). We can play just to play! Then\npeople won’t fall into the pit of thinking that they need to provide for every\nneed. When one plays, they fulfill who people were created to be. Play is a\nstructure of human life, and they acknowledge that they can’t provide for their\nevery need. Never playing can convey an attitude of a lack of trust. Here is\nwhere the connection between play and rest can be seen. Rest is a time in which\nwe reflect on God’s provision for our needs (Marshall 100). Church events\ncentered on play could include a short teaching on the biblical perspective on\nplay, or this lesson could be taught at a separate time, perhaps as part of a\nSunday school series on worldview.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Part of Christian\nworldview involves our responses to the world, one of which is play, an our\ntasks in the world, one of which is art. The arts are another area where the\nchurch can work to empower its members to live fully according to . The arts,\naccording to Marshall, and International Arts Movement, are an essential part\nof being human (155). Through them we become fully alive, and we express part\nof ourselves. Through art we bear the image of God, we birth beauty into the\nworld.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Heidi from\nInternational arts movement described that in expressing ourselves we are\nvulnerable because we often express a feeling of ours. Through this process we\nare made vulnerable, because we let a part of ourselves out. If art is part of\nliving out God’s will for humans, the the church ought to aid in it’s members\nability to engage with art.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Andy Crouch suggested\na change the church can make to more fully incorporate artists’ into its midst\nis to provide a position for artists to teach the laity how to respond to images.\nIn a personal conversation, Crouch suggested that humanity is transitioning\nfrom a literary age to a visual age. In a literary culture, the most important\npieces of information are communicated through text, and speech is not the\nprimary form through which authoritative pieces of information are\ncommunicated.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While we may not\ncome to a point where the most important pieces of information our culture\ncommunicates are images, but they are becoming more dominant in our culture.\nGreg Carmer suggested in the conversation that millenials often look websites\nfor hours, looking primarily at images. A website like Stumbleupon or Tumblr\nprovides this sort of entertainment. Because this type of entertainment,\nlooking through hundreds of different photos daily is common place for the\nmillenial generation, who learn natural image composition by this habit. Crouch\nmade this observation while on a safari with a perhaps 50 year old doctor and\nhis 15 year old daughter. Her photos were few and gorgeous, with a point and\nshoot camera, while the doctor’s were many and decent. Her’s were well\ncomposed—the rule of thirds was employed.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The observations\nabout images and films being a more common way of communicating seems true, and\nbecause of more images presented in our culture, and messages being sent\nthrough images, it would help if artists taught people how they could interpret\nimages, what certain types of presentation means, etc.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another way\nartists could be incorporated fully into the church is through being brought on\nstage. A person on stage, talking about certain things is a key way the church\ndisplays visually it’s values. The artist could once per month have a short\npart of the service in which they teach about interpreting an image. There\ncould be a piece of art or an image used in an advertisement portrayed on\nscreen, and they could teach about how the colors, the composition, the\nshadows, the focus, the lines, the font, etc., convey meaning. They could tie\nthe image into a spiritual idea. In order to free the presentation from needing\na theological connotation, The church could teach that in understanding and\nappreciating art</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Images presented\nand taught on in church should not always have a theological meaning drawn out\nof them. If a watercolor of a lion is projected onto the screen, or a physical\npainting brought on stage, a metaphor about the lion of Judah need not be\nmentioned, especially if the creator did not intend for that to be the meaning\nof the painting. It is a worship service, and always explaining images with a\ntheological perspective could result in the church believing they need to think\nof all art as containing a statement about God, and finding that statement is\nthe most important aspect of worship. If the artist did not intend to convey a\ntheological message, then a theological message need not be extracted from the\nimage. Keeping the question, how do we respond to imagery as Christians,\npresent may help frame these presentations in such a way that does not leave\nlaity feeling that their calling as Christians is to pull a theological idea\nout of every image they see.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Again, my motivation\nin changing what is on the stage stems from my stifling belief in high school\nthat I listening to music that wasn’t explicitly Christian was a waste of time.\nI have grown to realize the beauty in music made by non-Christians, with lyrics\nthat convey human emotions and relationships in a crystal clear manner. Many\nhave created beautiful art who have not been Christians, and to reject this\nwork is to reject a large portion of beauty that has been created.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I watched <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</i> this past Mardi\nGras, during which Paul Stapleton taught me about the messages sent through\ncolors. I experienced more full life through this. The main girl’s room was\npink, and the main boy’s blue. She wore pink through the beginning of the\nmovie, and after she went home with the boy and slept with him, the next scene\nshe was pictured at home she came out wearing the boy’s blue, to represent her\nheart being wholly for him—her new connection with him. I comprehended the\nmeaning of the story more fully through knowing this principle about film color\nin this movie. I did not interpolate any theological ideas into this story\nusing my understanding of this art technique, I simply enjoyed and appreciated\nthe film more fully. Art is ultimately still connected to God by the fact that\nit is his image bearers who are creating it, and their ability to create art\nwas given by him. God intends for people to apprehend the meaning of art, even\nif it is not teaching a truth explicitly about him. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A potential\nproblem with these ideas is that they stray quite far from what has\ntraditionally been included in a worship service, but they could inspire\nmembers to play more, engage more thoughtfully with images in the world, and do\nharder work, with a clearer conscious, knowing that their work is just as\nimportant as the work of the pastor, and just as valued and celebrated by the\nchurch.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In sum, if a\nchurch changes what they present on stage, they will reinforce the idea that\nChristians are called to appreciate many kinds of things in the world, and do\nmany types of work. The divide between sacred and secular will then have a more\ndifficult time creeping into the minds, lives, and hearts of the church\nmembers. If I had grown up in this type of church culture, I would not have\ngrown up feeling inferior&#8211;like I could never entirely live the life God has\ncalled me too. Bring biophysicists on stage to present their accomplishments.\nHave artists teach people how to understand the world by teaching what images\nmean. Let the church talk about play as important in and of itself, that not\nevery act of ours needs an externally productive end. Let pastors, physicists,\nand those in puberty play to play.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;\nline-height:200%'>Bibliography</p>\n\n<w:Sdt Bibliography=\"t\" ID=\"111145805\">\n <p class=MsoBibliography style='line-height:200%'>Carmer, Greg.
