I have since changed my opinions on the topic. One change is my finding that the more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)\">elasticity</a> exists in a particular aspect of the economy, the better suited that segment is to low government regulation, and vice versa. The shampoo market in 2020&#8217;s United States is relatively elastic. If companies make shampoo too expensive, the demand curve will decrease accordingly. People may begin making their own shampoo from cheaper ingredients. On the contrary, in less elastic markets – markets where demand remains consistent even when cost increases, such as healthcare and incarceration, greater benefit results from more government regulation.
