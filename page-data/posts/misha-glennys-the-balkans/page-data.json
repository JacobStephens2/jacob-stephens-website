I had not considered how long that term has been in use. I then wonder <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">how people of that region referred to\nthemselves before &#8220;the Balkans&#8221; was applied to them. Is this a\nfruitful question to pursue? What&#8217;s the significance of the name of a region?</b>\nPerhaps more significant is the connotation that name has.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;\ncolor:black\">The Balkans has a negative reputation, which I found interesting\nbecause of the way that relates to Balkan peoples’ identities. <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">Do people end up refusing to accept the\nlabel of “I’m from the Balkans” or “I am a person of the Balkans”, or even “I\nam Balkan”, because of the negative connotation that Glenny describes that term\nhas?</b> Perhaps people are quicker to accept being “Croatian” or “Bosnian”\nthan they are being “Balkan”? This compares to someone from New Zealand\npreferring the demonym, “New Zealander” to “Pacific Islander”. Do people prefer\ntheir national demonym or their regional, geographic demonym?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;\ncolor:black\">I’m left with a question about what the term “the Balkans” refers\nto. <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">Does “the Balkans” refer to a geographical\narea? Or to countries with particular histories? </b>Who is an authoritative\nsource for answering this question? A historian like Misha Glenny? How can I\nreason for myself what the Balkans is? Or do we simply need to specify what we\nmean by the term “Balkans” every time we use it? At least, there is a generally\nunderstood meaning of this term, which encompasses southeast Europe and some of\nWestern Asia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black\">Does the\nBalkans really have a bad reputation?</span></b><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;\nfont-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;color:black\"> It depends on which audience\nyou’re asking, and what makes up for a negative reputation. Looking at Gordon\nCollege, there is a general sense of awe over the Balkans. People find it a\nfascinating place, not a disgusting place. Glenny talks about the negative view\nthat many people have, and he especially focuses on the mid 20<sup>th</sup>\ncentury United States American public consciousness. With their view of the\nBalkans comes a view that it is a place which is backwards and primitive in its\ntechnology, but even more strongly is a view of the people that understands\nthem to be sneaky, un-trustable people who cannot get along, and are not\ncivilized. My grandmother, a high-school educated woman who lived in Berks\nCounty, Pennsylvania her whole life, particularly in a small town named\nMohnton, thought I might be going to a village to live in a hut after she found\nout I was going to Croatia. I showed her a virtual tour of Zagreb through\nGoogle Maps though, and she was relieved. According to Glenny, she seems to\nrepresent a large part of the American public, who don’t view countries in the\nBalkans as well developed nations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Let’s\ntake the reputation question one step further. <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:\nnormal\">Does the negative reputation the Balkans has represent the reality of\nthe region?</b> Do people in the Balkans really not have the ability to live in\ndiversity? Are they really without the ability to live amongst a variety of\nethnicities and religions? I doubt it. My doubt comes from the words I’ve heard\nfrom Gordon students and faculty about the area. One of the faculty mentioned\nfeeling a sense of safety in the region. And another faculty member mentioned\nthe way that guests will take interest in us students as we hear from them,\nwhich gives me a good impression of the people. In my impression, I imagine some\nBalkan people to be engaged in restorative work, and to be very civil and\ninformed people, who want to shed their bad image by changing and by proving\nthe world it is inaccurate. But I also imagine some people will be callous and\nbitter because of the past.<span style=\"color:black\"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Finally,\n<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">what is a good response to the bad image\nthat the Balkans has?</b> First, according to the transcendental imperatives of\nBernard Lonergan, we ought to be intelligent, and <span class=\"SpellE\">identitfy</span>\npatterns that exist. A pattern to look for is what people are already doing to\ncorrect this image and make it not only more accurate, but also <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">what are people doing to make the image\nbetter?</b> Then, is that work good? Are they doing good work? That is, work\nwhich moves us towards what is good, true, and beautiful? If so, partnering\nwith them in what they are doing would be a good response, and a fitting\nresponse to what’s going on, to the world around us, and to the history of\nactions that have been taken on us and on what we are investigating. Improve\nthe image of the Balkans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote this reflection for the first course of a study abroad semester in the Balkans, at the European Center for the Study of War and Peace.
