As I have had fears regarding medical school, and\nthere seems to be a general aura of “wow, medical school sounds like it will\ndestroy your life” or at least be inanely difficult. However, through reading\nthis I was able to imagine myself in a similar situation to the ones he\ndescribed and learned where I would do well and would have a more difficult\ntime. My fear of the unknown was quelled by reading this largely narrative\npiece. His descriptions of his thoughts and perceptions of the other people he\nencountered are honest and realistic.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>Savett, Laurence. <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Human Side of Medicine: Learning what\nit’s like to be a Patient and to be a Physician</i>. 256pp. I recommend this\nbook highly, as it gave me a vicarious feel for what life as a medicine is\nlike. It gave me a sense for what range of topics physicians regularly think\nabout: the types of decisions they need to make, what are key questions they\nneed to ask, ought they collaborate with another professional on a particular\ndecision? Through reading this I also developed hope for the presence of\nphysicians who take great care to notice humane aspects of medicine. Not to say\nthat before reading this book I had a dismal outlook on how many physicians are\nwarm, kind, compassionate people, but it encourages me regarding the direction\nof medicine, portraying a move towards medicine which is more sensitive to\npatients and gives them more respect and more wholesome care (paying attention\nnot only to their body, but the rest of their life as well). He gives much\npractical advice on interact with patients on a “human” level, some of which is\nrepeated throughout the book, but this ended up serving to strengthen my memory\nof those concepts.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>1. What do you feel are the most important\nqualities in being a good doctor (nurse or whichever is appropriate for you)?\nWhy do you believe this?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>As a physician, detail\norientation is critical, partly thanks to the precision they need to have in\nwriting patient notes after the time they spend speaking with the patient.\nAnother reason for this is their need to fill out paperwork about many things,\ndue to the legal status and potential implications of the work they do. Another\ncharacteristic of their work is contacting patients in follow up, which\nrequires excellent organizational skills, especially when the number of\npatients one sees in a day may exceed 25. If attention is not paid to detail,\nthen there may be incorrect diagnoses, as details mentioned by the patient that\nmay seem minor to him may in actuality be critical for proper diagnosis. The\nrepercussions of misdiagnosis could lead to other complications and symptoms,\nand simply prolong the healing process, causing more suffering and finances to\nbe extricated from the patient.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>Physicians must be sensitive to\npatients, otherwise the patients may feel disrespected, and a menagerie of\nother effects could trickle down from insensitivity which lead to poor healing.\nHaving a negative attitude towards a patient may cause them to feel emotional\nstress, which can lead to further illness. The physician works to help patients\nheal, if he is behaving in such a way that leads to further disease a major\nproblem has arisen. Compassion aids in recovery, and gives way to trust, which\ntends to yield greater sharing of detail on the patient’s behalf, which may\nlead to better diagnosis and care. Sensitivity creates an environment that is\nmore enjoyable for patients to be in, and while they are suffering, any extra\nbit of joy that can be given to them proves valuable in helping them become\nbetter. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>2. What are three things you want\nto change about yourself?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>I want to become more humorous,\nand appropriately humorous. Another valuable skill of physicians is humor\nconveyed with skill, as this can help patients feel better as well. Though\nthere are serious moments in which humor is inappropriate, there are other\ntimes which it proves helpful to deal with the gloom that often comes with\ndisease, especially for patients with certain personalities. People tell me that\nI am humorous, but I struggle to make a joke when I sense that it’s appropriate\nor even important at a particular moment. I recall a moment where a friend of\nmine had just failed a chemistry exam, and as he sat down, on the verge of\ntears thanks to his effort studying that seemed to go to waste, I sensed that a\njoke about myself not doing too great on an exam might help alleviate some of\nthe gloom. I didn’t think of anything, but simply continued to listen to him\nand affirm him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>I also want to become more openly\ncollaborative in my studies. I tend to let my fear of being judged or viewed as\nunintelligent paralyze me from asking questions during class. My desire to\nstudy something independently and be able to figure it out on my own is flawed.\nI am learning the need for community in learning, and that learning is a\ncommunal act.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>Finally, I would become one who\ngives out responsibility of mine to others more. As a resident advisor I find\nmyself overwhelmed at having to plan events and dinners and fellowships in\naddition to my other commitments. Delegating out this work would help me keep\nfrom becoming burnt out, and also develop a stronger sense of interdependence\nbetween myself and those who I live with.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>3. What are your hobbies or\nnon-academic interests? </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>I enjoy swing dancing. When I\ncame to Gordon College, I taught a number of my friends how to dance, and since\nthey have created a swing dancing club. I swing dance at least once every\ncouple of weeks, and I have taken classes at a ball room at home. It’s fun, an\neasy way to connect with and meet new people, and dancing is something that a\nlot of people don’t do; this provides an easy way for people who “don’t dance”\nto learn. Plus, seventh chords strike my heart in a special way.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>Reading, writing, and conversing\nare all pretty basic, but I enjoy doing them, and find much value in them.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>4. Considering your academic\ncareer, if you could have done anything different in your education, what would\nit be?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>I would have taken a gap year\nbetween high school and college to settle my interests a bit more, as well as\ncreate a more coherent plan for my four-year schedule at Gordon.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''>During high school and middle\nschool, I would have studied <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>significantly</i>\nmore, and turned everything in on time, and worked and studied with my peers\nand professors more closely. This would have set habits in me which would prove\nuseful and fruitful through to this day. I have had to learn these skills of\ntime management and studying in college, and that has been an extra step which\nhas made stellar academic performance more of a struggle than it would have\nbeen if I came into college with a basic set of those skills.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style=''><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n</div>\n\n","title":"Health Professions Mock Interview: Part Two","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/autobiography/","name":"Autobiography"},{"link":"/posts/category/health/","name":"Health"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"Elements of Responsible Action: My Responsible Student Ethics","uri":"/posts/elements-of-responsible-action-my-responsible-student-ethics/"},"prevPost":{"title":"Finding Greener Alternatives for the AP Chromatography Lab","uri":"/posts/finding-greener-alternatives-to-ap-chromatography-lab/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":542,"nextId":685,"prevId":294}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
