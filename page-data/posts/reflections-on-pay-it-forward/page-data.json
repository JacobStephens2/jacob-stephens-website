In the movie there was a girl who was about to\ncommit suicide, she was very stressed out and upset. But then Jerry came along\nand talked to her, offered help, and he offered to have a cup of coffee with\nher. Jerry let her know that someone in the world cared for her, and that there\nwere other options besides suicide. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>We learned in health class that often people with depression\noften feel their only option to alleviate their pain is through suicide. Ways\nto help someone else with their suicidal feelings include letting them know\nthat they are loved, and giving them medical treatment through pills, ex.\nLexapro and Zoloft.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>I have had experiences with friends of mine who were\nsuicidal. It is a very difficult thing to deal with. I helped them out by\nletting them know I cared about them, and by recommending them to search for\nmedical treatment, because depression (causing suicidal feelings) is an\nillness. This is something that has become easier to deal with as I’ve dealt\nwith more and more people with suicidal feelings.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In class we learned about bullying, about why people do it,\nand how to deal with it. Trevor’s friend kept getting beat up by the older and\nbigger kids. This really hurt the little guy. Eventually, Trevor made a stand\nand stood up for his friend, potentially saving his life. Sadly, the bullies\ntook Trevor’s life <br>\nwith a knife.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>We learned in class that one of the biggest reasons people\nbully others is because they are hurting. Maybe the bullies got beat up when\nthey were younger, so they feel they have a right to do the same to others. Hurt\npeople hurt people.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When I came to Twin Valley, I saw a lot more open bullying\nthan I did at my other school. I sat next to this one guy in chorus, not too\npopular or “cool”, but we soon became friends. He didn’t really have many other\nfriends. I then really started to care about this guy, so I invited him to come\nsit with me at my lunch table. He likes it, but sometimes this girl at our\ntable makes fun of him for being weird. At first, I didn’t do anything, but I\nsoon learned to stand up for him, even though she likes me less when I do. I\nwant to work on defending these sorts of people even more effectively.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>We learned a lot about sexuality in health class, that was a\nvery, very interesting week. The mother worked at a stripper bar, where men\nwould come, get drunk, and want to have sex with the girls. Also, in the movie,\nEugene and Arlene felt great attraction for each other, they kissed but he\nrealized how much it would change his life, so he pulled away. But as their\nrelationship grew deeper, they decided to have sex, to share their bodies. They\nwere ready for the consequences.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In health class we learned about how incredibly powerful sex\nis, how it can create life, destroy life (through STI’s), and bind two people\ntogether. Sex is something that two people should choose carefully to share,\nand only when they are ready for the potential consequences. I also learned that\nsexuality is not limited to the physical, but also consists of spiritual,\ncultural, emotional, and cultural aspects.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>I have felt a bit of the incredible bond that sexuality can\ncreate: through kissing, through sharing deeply emotional thoughts, and through\npraying with a significant other. Something I have always liked about a dating\nrelationship I have had is that we felt the freedom to talk about almost\nanything. It’s harder to leave someone once you’ve shared such deep emotions\nwith someone. I want to work on controlling <br>\nmy sexuality.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>We learned about all sorts of addictions in health class. Jerry\nand Arlene both were addicted in the movie, Jerry to heroin, and Arlene to\nAlcohol. Jerry’s life had been messed up by his heroin addiction, to the point\nof making him homeless. Even after Trevor helped him back on his feet he still\ncouldn’t get away from his addiction. He knew he had a problem though. Arlene\nwould turn to alcohol as a way to self-medicate herself every time she felt\npain in her life. She hid it all over the house, ex. In the dishwasher, lights,\netc. She hid her problem, but as the story went on, and as she faced the\nreality of her problem more and more, she told Trevor the truth, and he helped\nkeep her sober.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In health class we learned about addictions, what they are, symptoms,\nand ways to get out of them. After you realize that you have a problem, some\nways that can help getting out of addiction include having an accountability\npartner (telling someone is very important! It’s hard to fight addiction alone)\nand getting treatment.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>I see my neighbor out smoking when times are tough for her. She’s\nsaid so many times how she wants to stop, but that it’s so hard. I would advise\nher to look for other ways to deal with her pain, and to ask a good friend of\nhers to keep her accountable, or even for her to seek treatment. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>One of the more recent things we learned about in health\nclass was first aid. In the movie Trevor was stabbed with a knife in a fight,\ncausing some seriously severe bleeding. He bled out before the hospital arrived\nand died.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>We learned in the class on first aid that when someone is\nseverely bleeding the first thing you need to do is call 9-1-1, and then apply\npressure. Next you need to keep layering the wound with cloth and bandages,\nwhatever you can to help slow the bleeding until they can get the wound\nstitched/skin grafted.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Last summer I was riding my bike to my youth leader’s house\nand on the way over I came to a very steep hill with a curved road. I had been\nhaving trouble with my bike chain, it fell off while I was going down the hill,\nI looked down to see a detached chain, looked back up to see I was off road\nheaded for a mailbox at 30mph on a road bike. Smash! I hit the box and slid\nacross the driveway next to it, next thing I know I’m hobbling out to grab my\nbike from the middle of the road. I’m sore and bleeding all over, profusely\nfrom my arm that hit the box, and my hip that slid across the driveway. Two elderlies\npayed it forward for me by taking me to my youth leader’s house and giving me\nsome towels to apply immediate pressure. After arriving we bandaged and washed every\nwound.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n","title":"Reflections on Pay It Forward","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/health/","name":"Health"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"The chase: traceurs vs. guards","uri":"/posts/the-chase-traceurs-vs-guards/"},"prevPost":{"title":"Response to Paul Rusesabagina’s An Ordinary Man","uri":"/posts/response-to-rusesabaginas-an-ordinary-man/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":533,"nextId":520,"prevId":480}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
