I was not sure about how well I would be able to describe\npolitical matters. Even to describe an action as “political”, I had a foggy\nunderstanding of what sort of examples could flesh out that generalized\ndescription. I felt stressed and challenged by the conference. But after coming\nthrough this experience, I learned to <span class=GramE>more skillfully discuss\npolitical topics</span>, and also, I see more clearly how well I might fit into\ndiplomacy and mediation type work. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Leading\nup to model UN I felt intimidated in the preparation classes, especially where\nI was supposed to speak. The speeches were the aspect I felt most nervous <span\nclass=GramE>about, because</span> I was not terribly confident in my ability to\ngo into a speech that I haven’t had much time to prepare, and I felt unconfident\nspeaking in the Libya simulation because I didn’t feel like I had mastery over\nthe history and position of Libya on various matters. But I have since learned\nto have a single point and trust myself to be able to elaborate on it on the\nspot and say things I haven’t thought of before, until that moment. Also, I\nrealized the importance of sometimes being able to take a position on something\nI know I’m not entirely informed about. It’s okay if I take a stance on\nsomething <span class=GramE>before</span> I have spent all the time I feel\nnecessary to master the <span class=SpellE>relevent</span> information. <span\nclass=GramE>So</span> I did not need to know all the details of Libya’s history\non the tip of my tongue mastery level in order to defend and take a position.\nOf course, having mastery over the history of Libya and current events would\nhave been an invaluable tool. It was not necessary to participate, and thus I\nrealized to combat some of my fear of participating in things when I feel I\nhaven’t put as much time in as I should have. Dr. Green said something\nenlightening today that I think I can put back on this Model UN experience:\n“The grade doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you do the best you can with\nthe time you have.” There are very few topics of discussion I am going to feel\nlike I have mastery over before I discuss them. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>And</i>, more profoundly discombobulating my paralyzed engagement in\ngroup discussions at times, my fear of engaging for the fear of messing up or\nsounding stupid, or stumbling for words, is the realization that <span\nclass=GramE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in order </i>to</span> gain\nmastery of a topic to discuss it eloquently I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>must</i> discuss it and stutter through it and mess up. You made it\nclear that we ought to take risks and make mistakes in our simulations, because\nthat was a safer place to do so than at Harvard.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Besides\nwhat I learned in <span class=GramE>class,</span> I learned a lot at the conference.\nWhile mastery is not a prerequisite for influential participation at a\nconference, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some </i>knowledge must be\ngarnered as to hold a basic position on various substantive issues <span\nclass=GramE>in order to</span> productively converse and form working\nrelationships with people. “Relative intelligence is more important than\nabsolute intelligence.” A quote from class that bolstered my confidence to\nengage despite my self-perception that my absolute intelligence about the topic\nat hand was not very extensive. Maybe I was underestimating myself, but at\nleast it gave me a disposition in interacting with others that allowed me to\nfreely listen and critique what I thought, because I knew that what I knew was\nnot complete, and I needed the knowledge of these other delegates in order to\nhave a <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>well formed</span></span> plan of\naction. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As\nfar as suggesting how to change the program in the future. I suggest having two\nnational simulations rather than a small scale one and an international one.\nThis gives more preparation to those who are new to model UN to practice taking\non the role of a country, which requires different background understanding\nfrom role-playing or representing a person in an organization. I acknowledge\nthe benefit that a local scenario has—a topic more familiar which is easier to\ndescribe and discuss. And yes, I realize that the focus of the first simulation\nis more on learning parliamentary procedure than on substantive debate, but I\nthink making the switch to a more substantive topic would be worth the sacrifice\nof giving up a debate that is more primarily focused on learning parliamentary\nprocedure. Two international debates would give more practice to delegates on\nthinking about and preparing for debate on these larger, international topics.\nI wish I had been slightly more prepared with more solid opinions about what\nneeded to be done coming <span class=GramE>in to</span> the conference. However,\nthe class and you did suggest coming into the conference knowing clear\npositions and what we were willing to secede on and what we were not, so I\nshould have come in having put more effort into preparing that. I think doing\none more international debate would have prepared me for that as well.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span></p>\n\n</div>\n","title":"I fit into international diplomacy","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/autobiography/","name":"Autobiography"},{"link":"/posts/category/political-science/","name":"Politics"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"Reflection on heteroism","uri":"/posts/reflection-on-heteroism/"},"prevPost":{"title":"Two Natures, One Being: My Perspective on the Person of Christ Compared and Contrasted with Bonhoeffer’s Understanding as Primarily Conveyed in Life Together","uri":"/posts/two-natures-one-being/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":755,"nextId":771,"prevId":724}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
