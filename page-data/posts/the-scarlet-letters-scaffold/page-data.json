Each of the scaffold scenes are vividly painted by Hawthorne. One is in\nchapters two through three, where Hester&#8217;s sin is made public, the next is in\nchapter twelve, where Hester, Pearl, and Dimmesdale stand upon the scaffold at\nmidnight, and the last is in chapter twenty-three, where Dimmesdale stands upon\nthe scaffold with Hester and Pearl at mid-day and confesses his sin and dies.\nEach scaffold scene is symbolic of something different, portray different\ninteractions between characters, and has different purposes and outcomes. </span><span\nstyle='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In\nthe first scaffold scene of chapters two through three, Hester&#8217;s forced\nconfession upon the scaffold symbolizes performance-based church discipline,\nconveys the first interactions between Dimmesdale, Chillingworth, and Hester,\nand <span class=GramE>it&#8217;s</span> purpose and outcome is to present the three\nmain character&#8217;s initial reactions of guilt, pride, and acceptance of this sin.\nHester&#8217;s forced confession symbolizes performance-based church <span\nclass=GramE>discipline, because</span> no grace is allowed for the repentant\nHester, and her sin is forced to be revealed as punishment for her sin.\nConcerning interactions, Hester sees Chillingworth in the <span class=GramE>crowd</span>\nand he sees her upon the scaffold; their initial interaction is full of wonder\nand shame, also Dimmesdale is tender with Hester, revealing his feelings of\nsympathy for her. Hester accepts her own sin without guilt because it is\nconfessed to the people, so she has nothing to hide. Dimmesdale&#8217;s guilt begins\nto rise from this point on, as he knows he should confess his sin, but cannot\nbring himself to it. Chillingworth&#8217;s pride begins to consume himself from this\nfirst scaffold scene onwards, because he thinks himself better than Dimmesdale\nand his unfaithful Hester.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In\nthe second scaffold scene, painted in chapter twelve, Dimmesdale stands on the\nscaffold at midnight with Hester and Pearl.

This is one of the first scenes that\ndisplays Dimmesdale&#8217;s remaining feelings of affection for Hester and Pearl.\nDimmesdale tells Hester that he wants to confess during the light of the <span\nclass=GramE>day, and</span> tells Pearl they will be together at some point in\nthe future, but at this point in the story he still cannot quite bring himself\nto do it.</span><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The\nfinal scaffold scene, revealed in chapter twenty-three, holds </span><span\nstyle='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-bidi-font-family:\"Arial Unicode MS\"'>Dimmesdale&#8217;s\nfinal confession upon the scaffold with Hester and Pearl, which symbolizes\nrighteousness, portrays a releasing interaction between Dimmesdale, Hester,\nPearl, Chillingworth, and the townspeople, and <span class=GramE>it&#8217;s</span>\npurpose and outcome is to free a person bound by guilt, bring respect to\nHester, free Pearl from oddity, and boil Chillingworth in his pride.\nDimmesdale&#8217;s confession to the people symbolizes true righteousness, which is\nopposed with the facade of righteousness put on by many pastors who do not\nconfess their guilty sins. This interaction between Dimmesdale and everyone\nelse releases himself from his pride, releases Hester from being looked down on\nby the townspeople, and releases Pearl to be a normal child. As for\nChillingworth, Dimmesdale&#8217;s confession in the third scene upon the scaffold\nruins him, as he no longer has anyone to take revenge on (which was born out of\nhis pride).</span><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=Body style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The\nfirst scaffold scene portrayed the onset of guilt, judgment, and pride. The\nsecond scaffold scene revealed the desires of Hester to be rid of judgment and\nof Dimmesdale to be rid of his guilt. The final scaffold scene releases key\ncharacters from these feelings, as Dimmesdale confesses and is finally freed of\nguilt, Hester gains respect of the townspeople through Dimmesdale&#8217;s confession\nand death, and Pearl from being odd and isolated. However, Dimmesdale&#8217;s\nconfession did nothing to release Chillingworth from his pride, rather, Chillingworth\nshriveled away and died in response.
