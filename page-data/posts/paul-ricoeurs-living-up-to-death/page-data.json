The French\nPhilosopher, Paul Ricœur, by then age 82, has conversations on death with a\nlong-time friend of his, Catherine Goldenstein. Presently, she speculates he\nsoon after those conversations began thinking and writing the manuscripts that\nbecame <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Up to Death. Mourning and\nCheerfulness</i>. At the beginning of 1996, his wife’s health began degrading much\nmore quickly than it had been. In 1997 he stopped this work on death, because\nit became too great a weight to bear. Fast forward to 2005, age 92, Ricœur passed\naway. 2009, his friend Goldenstein found the handwritten drafts he worked on\naround the time of his wife’s death, and made it part of what is now a book\nentitled <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Living Up to Death</i>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">The central focus\nof <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Living Up to Death</i> is on mourning\nour desire to survive death, and in response he suggests a life focused on\nliving rather than on dying. The life focused on living, as Ricœur describes it,\nattempts to imitate Jesus’ service. In this way we have the “gift of life” in\nsuch a way that we contribute to others’ lives. Furthermore, Ricœur advocates\nheeding Jesus’ teachings on renouncing the self. The reward for life\ncharacterized by these things is primarily cheerfulness, though he explores the\npotential of eternal life which exists in God’s memory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">The problem Ricœur\naddresses is the anxiety people feel when realizing their impending death. This\nanxiety becomes a problem when it distracts the anxious person from living\nwell, which here is life marked by service, renouncement, and cheerfulness. He\nattempts to relieve this anxiety with philosophical reflection, because, as he\ndescribes, philosophical reflection will untangle a few different senses attached\nto the word death. This clarification offered by this first untangling-type\nmovement should give us a bit of relief from the anxiety we feel looking\nforward to death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Ricœur explores\nthree meanings of death. Each of these three meanings in some way has to do\nwith our imagination of death. His first sense about death is in regard to the\nfuture perfect tense, where I imagine myself in the position where I can look\nback on the experience of having died. This is where questions like, “where do\nthe dead presently live?” come from. These questions, Ricœur thinks, are\nultimately useless, because they aim at something which may not exist.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Death\nas an event is the next idea Ricœur presents, death as a position where people\nare coming around ones’ death bed, the meaning of death there is that when we\nimagine ourselves in that future perspective we can mix up our perspectives of\nthe onlookers and the actual person there. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">In the third way\nsomeone understands death in response to an experience of surviving and encountering\nthe death of another, Ricœur examines is death as a character who may be called\n“absolute Evil” (28). He explains the origin of this understanding as coming\nout of situations of where there are massive amounts of dead—concentration\ncamps for example. An important detail here is that the death must be on such a\nscale that the person beholding it has difficulty distinguishing between the\ndead and the dying. If I look around the room and seem many people in terrible\ncondition and can’t tell who is dead and who is dying, then go outside and see\nthe same thing on the quad—this experience is where the idea of a personified\nevil Death originates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Taking a tangent\nto relate this point to our class, Ricœur wonders about whether the idea of\ndeath “as an active agent” would have ever been thought of if it weren’t for\nscenes of massive death, like concentration camps (27). In one of our class\ndiscussions, we looked at Jesus’ ideas from a sociological perspective, which\nunderstands Jesus’ ideas to have originated not from revelation, but from his\ncultural context. In a similarly secular vein, Ricœur in this moment of\nreflection considers the potential of the idea of Death as an active agent, as\nbeing in situations where the amount of dead present is overwhelming, like an\nepidemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">We can find\nanother connection in thinking about death as an agent, like we discussed in\nthe Death Dealt section of this course, death is sometimes understood as a\npersonified figure working on behalf of another. I remember the poem entitled,\n“Azarel,” and the accompanying figures, the hospice worker who is apparently\nlike Carl’s grandma, the lawyer&#8211;each of these figures helping somehow actively\ndeliver death.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">His first movement\nis characterized by three responses the person who encounters death develops.\nWhen we encounter someone’s death, a few questions arise in us, the survivors\nof that death, and these questions differ depending on how the person passed.\nEach of the three response he explains makes uses the imagination in our attempt\nto understand death. But this use of the imagination must be carefully\nexamined, and certain aspects must be put to death—mourned, that is, in order\nfor us to come to a point of cheerfulness, which again, is a life characterized\nby service that benefits others not only while it is alive, and that also\nbenefits others posthumously.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">The greatest\nrelief to the sense of anxiety Ricœur initially raised as problem, however,\ncomes at his second movement, where he details two thoughts that help point us\ntowards a truer, more fruitful way of living. The two thoughts can be described\nas “perfect detachment” and “confidence in God’s care.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">The detail that\nstuck out to me was the first sense of death. This is death as a sense where we\nimagine that we can look back and reflect on our death. He says that’s\nsomething which is not a helpful process. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">He says that is a\nsignificant position to him because he struggled with that idea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">And it’s\nsignificant to me because it expands my perspective where I can be satisfied in\na position where I cannot look back and reflect on my death. This is expanding\nmy understanding of different perspectives of death and looking at death.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote this paper for a course at Gordon College called Sociologies of Death.
