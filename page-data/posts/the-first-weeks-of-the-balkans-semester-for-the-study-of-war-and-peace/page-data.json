Petra Taylor functioned as the professor for these classes, and for\nmuch of the course she had a guest lecturer present, Marko Pogačar. Marko is a\npoet, author, as well as an editor for two literary publications. He was born\nin Yugoslavia, like Petra, and now travels Europe, attending conferences,\npresenting, writing, and lecturing. His master’s degree is in history, and he\nwas a fellow for <span class=\"GramE\">a number of</span> writing fellowships. The\nclass appreciates having him, and he is glad to be with the students. He has\nbrought a critical and unique perspective to the cohort’s dialogues, no matter\nwhether they happen in the classroom, during travel, or at mealtime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;line-height:200%\">They’re\ntalking about a <span class=\"GramE\">poem?</span> A brim?</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\">A group of people with backpacks\nsit outside. There’s a warm summer breeze. They’re on the top level of a\nterrace up a few levels from the street, sitting on assorted chairs, next to a\nwall with vines tumbling down, and in the corner of the fourth terrace up, the\ntop terrace, is a <span class=\"GramE\">big tall</span> tree, giving shade and the\noccasional falling leaves. White metal and green cushions for some, and for\nothers, wood worked chairs. They’re stumbling with their new Croatian words as\nthey put their coffee orders into the young <span class=\"GramE\">English speaking</span>\nwaiter, the smell of coffee rising up the steps from the café to the sitting\nterraces. At one end of these full of people, few tables put together sits a\ntall, fair skinned, slender, black haired man. His short sleeve shirt is\nbuttoned down a bit, and he has what look Ray Bans on. A question is directed\nat him:</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Marko,\nlooking at your poem, ‘What is a brim?’ caught me. The introductory phrase,</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in\">A brim is a category. an\nexpression of tradition, an edge</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in\">that is not to be crossed. its\nword is never</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in\">rebutted: under the brim there is\noften a head,</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in\">a house, a rare and arrogant\nnothing. the head, if</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\">gives me a frigid, stuck feel that\nstayed present throughout the three farm animals which were slaughtered in this\npoem. Would you talk a bit about what you intended for the reader in this\npoem?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marko\nin turn, raising the pitch of his voice a bit at first, “Well, a big part of my\ncreation of the literature is that it takes on a life of its own” his hands\ngesture out. “It begins to impact the readers in ways that I don’t always get\nto hear. I would very much appreciate getting to hear your responses.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A\nwoman sitting next to him, switches her countenance from him towards the group,\nlooking around from person to person. <span class=\"GramE\">“ I</span> just want to\nnote the last line, which I think is an important part of the whole piece:</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in;line-height:200%\">what is a brim\nand what is there under the brim?</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\">The way we answer these questions\nwill affect our understanding of this literature. Let’s hear some of what you\nguys thought about this poem.” Body leaned forward, her look turns to one of\nthem who has a notebook and pen out in front of her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>“Thanks Petra. I thought of these animals as\npeople who are being influenced by the state with a heavy hand. See the\nexcerpt:</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in\">a cow’s, is pierced with a steel\nbolt. the cow</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in\">is first chained to the damp walls\nof a barn, and then</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in\">struck fiercely. the blood gushing\nis the blood of</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:1.5in;line-height:200%\">the homeland.\nhomeland the cow had long claimed as its own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\">I imagine a person experiencing the\nimposition of restrictions and laws onto them – that’s the chaining, and this\nis a way of life that they’ve been living for many years, and many times, which\nwe see in that this cow has long claimed this place as its homeland. It is\nstruck. It receives violence in a way that is meant to keep it in line, and\nkeep it in the limits that the institution it’s now under wants to keep it in.\n&#8230;”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another\nstudent cuts in at a pause, “Okay. Remember what we talked about in chapter\nmeeting, what JT suggested about the system of violence? And the regime of\npeace? Perhaps the cow is living in the regime of violence. <span class=\"GramE\">Or,</span>\nthis person that the cow represents. It’s such a visceral scene, it looks dark,\ndeep red, and wet hay yellow to me, and quiet. Which is a beautiful way of\ngetting at the feel of darkness that there can be in this regime of violence.\nViolence has been chosen as a means of control by the leaders. And <span class=\"GramE\">so</span> if the cow is going to go against the homeland, he’ll be\nbeaten for it in order for the leaders to maintain control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The\nair hangs a bit, though still summer breezing. One of them leans forward after\nsipping his white coffee through a green straw, “But what about the steel bolt?\nI’m still perplexed by that. I like the image. But does it mean anything?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marko\nopens up, “Very good. Thank you for your perspectives and what meanings you\ndrew out of the text. When writing this <span class=\"GramE\">poem</span> I was\nthinking about religion. And the brim is the brim of a hat. Brim isn’t the best\ntranslation because it has more meanings than the word I used in Croatian. In\nCroatian the word is almost exclusively used to mean the brim of a hat, which\nis something that creates somewhat of a drape over <span class=\"GramE\">you, or</span>\ncan be viewed as encompassing your space. You can visualize a cylinder coming\ndown from the brim of the hat to form a circle around someone that they can’t\ncome out of.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“You\ncan think of this like the way that in a religion, sometimes there can be\nrestrictions put on people that are bad, and that keep them from moving out.\nThe critical sensibility can be fearfully shut out of these people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petra\nresponds, “I want to reinforce the importance of the author’s intention behind\nwriting a piece. I agree with Marko that the text does take on a life of its\nown, <span class=\"GramE\">but yet</span> the writer behind it does also inform us.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Looking\nat this can get us to start thinking about some of the things we before may\nhave taken for granted, or to imagine more widely. Text in literature can\nchallenge us and help us step inside the view the other has.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The\nwaiter comes up and starts to take dishes away. “<span class=\"SpellE\">Hvalah</span>”\nsome say, “Thank you.” </p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I went to the Balkans in the context of Gordon College&#8217;s core course, New Perspectives in Global Understanding.
