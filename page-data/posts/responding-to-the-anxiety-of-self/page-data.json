Furthermore, how does\nliterature portray human response to that anxiety? This paper will investigate the\nresponse of the main character in Aleksandar Hemon’s autobiographical novel, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The Book of My Lives</i>. This paper then asks\nif his response fits into the theological paradigm presented by James Taylor in\na discussion on September 29<sup>th</sup>, 2015. The theological framework I\npresent is a theory yet unpublished. The conceptual structure contains the\nregime of peace and the regime of violence as the two exhaustive responses to\nthe anxiety of being a self. This paper will ultimately argue that the main\ncharacter (Hemon), has a habit of confessing of his own finitude, which is a\nresponse of the regime of peace. However, Hemon’s rejection of a higher power\nthat could have established him is a response of the regime of violence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">To begin, what\ndoes it means to be a self? Kierkegaard gives some insight into this question\nin his philosophical treatise, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The\nSickness <span class=\"GramE\">Unto</span> Death</i>. “[T]he human self, a relation\nwhich relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self\nrelates itself to another” (Kierkegaard 10). There are further effects of this\nbeing a self that James Taylor explained. As the self relates itself to itself,\nself-consciousness arises. Then we realize that we participate in our own\nbecoming. We make choices that determine who we become, and our participation\nin our own self-development causes anxiety. We develop habits, good and bad as\nwe continually choose what to do. We are made up of habits. Participation in\nour own becoming creates anxiety. Our core question is as follows: how does the\ncentral person of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The Book of My Lives</i>\nanswer this anxiety? Through our investigation, we hope that we will illuminate\nthe text, and find depth in it previously undiscovered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">There are a few\nsections where we see some anxiety that Hemon had. In the chapter, “The Book of\nMy Life”, we hear Hemon’s relationship with his university literature\nprofessor. Their relationship is distinguished by much Shakespeare and much\npassion. As <span class=\"SpellE\">Koljević</span> becomes aligned with <span class=\"SpellE\">Karadžić</span> and begins to cover up the fact that he’s involved\nin genocide, Hemon realizes his old hero is no longer so heroic, but now seems\nmore villainous. Hemon says that he felt “racked with guilt” as he tried to remember\nwhen he “could have noticed [<span class=\"SpellE\">Koljević’s</span>] genocidal\nproclivities” (140). The language Hemon uses here shows that he is aware of his\nparticipation in his own self becoming. Hemon’s language that he “could have\nnoticed” <span class=\"GramE\">evidences</span> that he believes he was making\nchoices along the way, and he could have acted differently along the way in\norder to become different than the way he did become. Hemon does not buy into a\ndeterministic or fatalistic understanding of human life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Hemon realized\nthat he was taking a part in the formation of his self, and he realized that he\nhad been tainted by a person who was “plotting a vast crime” (141) &#8211; <span class=\"SpellE\">Koljević</span>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%\">“Now it seems\nclear to me that [<span class=\"SpellE\">Koljević’s</span>] evil had far more\ninfluence on me than his literary vision. I excised and exterminated that\nprecious, youthful part of me that had believed you could retreat from history\nand hide from evil in the comforts of art. Because of Professor <span class=\"SpellE\">Koljević</span>, perhaps, my writing is infused with testy\nimpatience for bourgeois babbling, regrettably tainted with helpless rage I\ncannot be rid of” (141).</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\">Here, Hemon admits that he has\nallowed callous ways of thinking to become ingrained in him. And that\nrealization gives him anxiety. Now Hemon we see the growth in Hemon of a sense that\nhe needs to do more work <span class=\"GramE\">in order to</span> retrain himself\nback to be less evil. Hemon laments, acknowledging that some parts of himself\nhe cannot change, that his writing is infused with “helpless range I cannot be\nrid of” (141).</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,\nHemon, in his consciousness of his own choice-making, makes no mention of a\nhigher power. We learn from Taylor that a higher power could be an infinite\nsource a self could align itself with in order to become changed – if change is\nthe will of the <span class=\"GramE\">god</span> one is aligning themselves with.\nIn addition, Hemon does not acknowledge a god anywhere else in a way that he\ncould depend on that god for some sort of real strengthening. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"GramE\">So</span> we can put forward\nthat Hemon rejects the existence of any god having any sort of real power to\nbring about empowerment and transformation in a self.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Let’s\nlook at another part of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The Book of My\nLives</i> where Hemon confesses his <span class=\"GramE\">limitations, but</span>\ndoes not turn to any supernatural being for strength. In the chapter,\n“Aquarium”, Hemon recounts his daughter Isabel’s struggle with brain cancer,\nand at one point he talks about the words that physicians used to describe to\nhim what was happening in his daughter. Let’s see. “But it looks like a\nteratoid,’ [the physician] said. I couldn’t comprehend the word <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">teratoid</i> either—it was outside my\nlanguage and experience, belonging to the domain of the unimaginable and\nincomprehensible, the domain into which Dr. Tomita was now guiding us” (228).\nHere the text emphasizes the language difference that occurred to Hemon while\nlistening to the physicians’ accounts of what was happening to his child. That\nmedical language Hemon could not comprehend. In that moment Hemon recognizes\nanother limitation of his – that he cannot fully understand what is happening\nto his daughter. Hemon doesn’t know precisely what the problem is. He can say\nit is brain cancer, but the details of what type and how it works are unknown\nto him, and he admits that. Again, Hemon notes his limitations, which is the\nfirst step in realizing one’s own resources are not enough to bring about\nchange at times (Taylor).</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,\nin this same chapter, the text again reveals a moment where Hemon felt helpless\nin the face of the tragedy unfurling before him. Here it is. “To the\naccompaniment of Bach cello concertos or Mingus piano pieces, my heart\nregistered every dip of Isabel’s heart rate, every change in her blood\npressure. I couldn’t take my eyes off the cruelly fluctuating numbers on the\nmonitors, as though sheer staring could influence the outcome. All we could\never do was wait” (233-234). Here the text brings us into a scene where Hemon\nsees the condition of his daughter in her dire situation, and he senses a\nfeeling of powerlessness. “All we could ever do was wait” (234), a statement of\nHemon’s which encompasses his realization that there’s almost nothing he could\ndo to control this situation. All he could do was wait and hope for her\nrecovery. This part of the text brings into light a valuable insight about\nfeeling helpless. When we feel helpless, and when we in our finitude really are\nhelpless, like Hemon was in this moment, we realize in a brutal way that we\ncannot control everything to the outcome we want, even if we put all our energy\ninto that one effort. Hemon and his wife Teri were constantly at the hospital\nby Isabel’s side, but what more could they do than wait? All they could do was\nsay to the physicians, “keep doing what you can to keep [Isabel] alive.” The <span class=\"SpellE\">Hemons</span> could not force their daughter to stay alive. Events\nhappened beyond their control, and in the sorrowful experience of their\ndaughter’s death, they <span class=\"GramE\">full</span> realized their own bounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hemon\nsees the limits of his comprehension again near the end of “Aquarium” Not only\ncould he not fully comprehend his daughter’s problem, or force her into\nrecovery, but he also could not “comprehend what was happening” (246). “I could\nnot write a story that would help me comprehend what was happening. Isabel’s\nillness overrode any kind of imaginative involvement on my part.” He noticed\nthe way that his daughter Ella was coping with the situation with her stories\nof Mingus and other imaginary family members. But Hemon himself could not\nmentally grasp what was going on. Something was happening outside of his\ninfluence, and it was horrible and painful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What\nare two theological categories of response an interpretation of Genesis can put\nforth? As James Taylor explained, there is the regime of violence and the\nregime of peace. Let’s look to stories in the <span class=\"SpellE\">Tawrat</span>\nfor further insight. In the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve lived in the kingdom\nof peace, where they depended on God’s provision for their needs – their\nphysical needs as well as their spiritual needs. They received gifts of fruit\nand accepted the identity and value that God gave to them. God walked closely\nwith Adam and Eve. God also told them not to eat of the fruit of the tree of\nthe knowledge of good and evil. Adam and Eve disobeyed, taking control of their\nown life, which went against the way that God had set for them. They trusted their\nown judgments above Gods. Above obeying God, their action shows that they\nsought to eat, enjoy, and gain wisdom. They heard God coming, and so they hid\nfrom him. God found them, then told them of the changes that were now happening\n<span class=\"GramE\">as a result of</span> their taking control for themselves.\nThese changes would have a stark impact on the world around them. A new\nhierarchy <span class=\"GramE\">would be set in</span> place, where peoples’ value\nwould come from a totem-pole like system of achievement, rather than the\ngift-based scheme God had started Adam and Eve in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Looking one step\nfurther, we find a story of life in this new world. We see the children of Adam\nand Eve relating to one another. Cain, the firstborn, brings some food from his\nfields to offer to God. Abel, the second-born, brings the <span class=\"GramE\">first-fruits</span>\nof his flock to offer to God. God looks upon Abel with favor, but not on Cain.\nCain becomes enraged, seeing that God is favoring the second-born. How\npreposterous! The firstborn is highest on the hierarchy! The firstborn should\nhave the greatest value! One way Cain devises to raise back to the top of the\nfood chain is by killing Abel. He does, and God curses him for it. This new\ndistorted system has the goal of gaining value by a self’s own strength, by\ndoing the greatest things, or by being highest in rank in the system set up in\nthe world. <span class=\"GramE\">In order to</span> get to the top of this system\nwe need to use violence, coercion, and force. In the life of Jesus, Isa, we see\nthe goal God has set for us, the way we are to live. Jesus sets the example of\nwhat human life is to like – and it is life in the regime of peace,\ndistinguished by equal value and dependence on God, as life was in the garden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recalling\nHemon’s response to realizing the bad habits <span class=\"SpellE\">Koljević</span>\nhad ingrained in him, we can see his response as step in the regime of peace. A\nkey feature of the kingdom of violence is independence that rejects any sort of\ndependence on an outer power that is beyond <span class=\"GramE\">one’s self</span>.\nA statement about one’s own weaknesses, and about one’s condition that one\ncannot do anything to change is a necessary an affirmation of one’s own limits\nis required. Here Hemon realizes that he cannot rid himself of this <span class=\"GramE\">condition, and</span> feels a sense of hopelessness towards the\npossibility of changing the “testy impatience” and “helpless rage” his writing\nis “infused” with (141).</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,\nHemon had part of his existence in the regime of violence as well, as we see\nthrough his dismissal of the actuality of God. Thinking of the way the text\nportrayed Hemon’s relationship with God during the section where he is dealing\nwith his daughter’s sickness, we can see the character of Hemon expressing the\naversion people have to examine their own death, going on to explain our\nefforts to “ease ourselves into death even as we mature”. “[A]s we mature into\nmortality, we gingerly dip our horror-tingling toes in the void, hoping that\nthe mind will somehow ease itself into dying, that God or some other soothing\nopiate will remain available as we venture deeper into the darkness of\nnonbeing” (234). Here Hemon equates God with an opiate, which partially gets\nacross the following message: Don’t try and escape the pain of mortality by\nsaying that God will make everything better. We also see in this statement an\noutlook on God that in focusing on him we will end up not dealing with some\nhard parts of reality. This attitude mirrors Marx’s suggestion in &#8220;A\nContribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right”, of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Works of Karl Marx 1843</i>. Marx states\nthat religion is “the opium of the people”. This statement indirectly expresses\nthat Hemon understands turning to God in response to facing his mortality to be\na weak response, not a strong response, as the regime of peace proposes, but\ninstead he’s encouraging that turning to God is a way to <span class=\"SpellE\">to</span>\nreject the fullness of the experience of a loved one passing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Harold Bush, Jr.,\na professor of Virginia Tech, published an article 8 years after the death of\nhis son, where he does respond to the sense of his own <span class=\"GramE\">bounds</span>\nhe likely learned in his son’s passing with a profession of God’s existence, as\nopposed to Hemon’s rejection of God, and we see that Bush’s acceptance of God’s\nexistence provided him with a sense of stability throughout the sorrowful\nperiod of his life that followed his son’s passing. The article reflected on\nthe continued sorrow he felt from the death of his son. Bush went through a\nsimilar child-loss experience to Hemon, and they responded slightly\ndifferently. Hemon stressed more in “Aquarium” his helplessness in the face of\nmedical trauma in his child. Bush did not focus so much on the experience of\nhelplessness he felt during the child’s <span class=\"GramE\">near death</span>\ndays, but he focused more on the post-death of a loved one experience, and what\nit was like for him to admit that God exists while he went through that period\nof time. We see at the end of “Aquarium” that the feeling of sorrow stayed with\nHemon. “Isabel’s indelible absence is now an organ in our bodies whose sole\nfunction is a continuous secretion of sorrow” (251). Bush echoes this same <span class=\"GramE\">experience, and</span> goes one step further to say that he did\nfind some grounding, and he managed to maintain a sense of meaning in life\nacknowledging that God is real, and provides grounding for his life. So here,\nBush, in the wake of his child’s death, realized that the way he responded to\nthe sorrow he experienced <span class=\"GramE\">as a result of</span> the death,\nwould influence who he became and what his life looked like. He felt the anxiety\nof being a self, and turned to simply admit that God exists, even in the face\nof this trauma. “Over these eight years, I have been thankful so many times to\nrealize that there was a little bit of rock underneath my life.” He didn’t go\non to try and explain why God let this happen, but he admitted that God exists.\nThis a step towards life fully ingrained in the regime of peace – admission of\nGod, which is a step in the direction of receiving the gifts of God, and living\na life characterized by dependence on God.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In\nconclusion, we see that Aleksandar Hemon’s <span class=\"GramE\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The</i></span><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"> Book of My Lives </i>portrays the author, the central character of the\nbook, as one who acknowledges that he is participating in his own\nself-becoming. He feels anxious <span class=\"GramE\">as a result of</span>\nrealizing this process. We examined two situations where he became aware of\nuncertain outcomes and felt nervous as a result. How did he respond? In the\nsituation with his professor <span class=\"SpellE\">Koljević</span>, he realized\nthat bad habits of writing had been fixed into his self, and he realized that\nthese could have negative effects. As one participating in his own becoming, he\nrealized he had a duty to respond to these negative effects. Admission of his\nproblem is a key attribute of his response to this self-anxiety. That is a step\nthat could direct someone to move into the regime of peace. As he tried to\nremove these negative habits of thinking and writing from <span class=\"GramE\">himself</span>\nhe failed, and realized he could not remove every bad tendency that had been\ndeveloped into him. He accepted this limitation with sadness. Another quality\nof life in the regime of peace is accepting one’s limitations, as opposed to\ntrying even harder to force oneself to not be limited in a particular area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">In examining Hemon’s\nresponse to Isabel becoming sick, we see that he realized his own lack of\nability to control her healing, coming to a painful head where he accepted this\npoint which he could not extend his influence past to cause greater change. He\nrealizes his finitude, which is an act in the kingdom of peace, but he rejects\nGod, which is of the regime of violence. He gave up trying to push past this\nlimit. He critiqued people’s platitudes that included God. Some of them can be\nterrible, and too many can take away from our full consciousness of the horror\nof losing a child. But an even greater reality includes God. It is good that he\naccepted his own limits, but what could have brought him even more into the\nregime of peace would be an acceptance of God, and a concession of God’s\nexistence, like Bush took. As a result of examining the responses Hemon has to\nhis anxiety of being a self, we see that he has a foot in both worlds, in the\nregime of peace, thanks to his confessions of his mortality, and a foot in the\nregime of violence because of his rejection of <span class=\"GramE\">God, and</span>\ncome to understand his character better through the lenses of the regimes of\npeace and violence, and the anxiety of self.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;\nline-height:200%\">Works Cited</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%\">Bush,\nHarold K.
