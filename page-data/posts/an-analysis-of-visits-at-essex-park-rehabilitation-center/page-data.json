I volunteer at Essex Park\nRehabilitation Center (EPRC) with the Gordon College Alzheimer’s Buddies\nprogram. It is a care center for people with dementia. My service there includes\naccompanying a “buddy”, a patient who has dementia. This essay systematically\nevaluates EPRC at a surface level. In Bernard Lonergan’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>The Invariant Structure of the Human Good</i>, a structure is set forth\nwhich Lonergan claims has presence in every organization.<a style='mso-footnote-id:\nftn1' href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[1]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nMatching parts of an organization with his structure helps discern where the\ngood and evil is. Using his structure, I will analyze EPRC. My first section\nwill focus on the particular goods of EPRC, followed by the particular evils of\nEPRC. After, I will identify where EPRC possesses the good of order. To do\nthis, I will identify where EPRC provides examples for the four defining\nconcepts of the good of order: regular recurrence of particular goods,\ncoordination of human operations (which is conditionally based on habits and\ninstitutions), material equipment, and personal status. To identify the good of\nvalue within EPRC would many more pages than I have to write. Finally, I will\nmake a concluding statement about the overall condition of EPRC—spoiler alert,\nEPRC’s good outweighs its bad.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Particular goods\nare things, events, the satisfactions of desires; visits to EPRC are events\nwhich patients experience. Visits satisfy residents’ desire for company. The\nevent of a greeting is a particular good, and receiving a wave goodbye is a\nparticular good. Frank is the name of my resident, and when he greets me, he\ncreates a particular good by that action. Systems may promote certain\nparticular goods. Visits are promoted by EPRC, as evidenced by the employees’\nencouragement towards residents to be kind to visitors. When residents go for\nlong periods of time without any visitors, they experience a lack of the\nparticular good of receiving guests. I am not sure how many of the patients\nfind themselves never having visitors. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Outsiders coming\nto spend time with people living in EPRC satisfies a desire of the residents,\nthus patients will long for regular visits. Where is the regular recurrence of goods?\nOur weekly check-ins to EPRC. Individual goods in EPRC are either present, promoted,\nsecured, or lacking, and when these statuses regarding the presence of\nparticular goods become regular, the good or evil of order is established. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What allows this recurrence\nof visits is the coordination of human operations. Duni, my Alzheimer’s Buddies\nteam leader drives me and four others to EPRC every week; always at 3:15 she\npulls up to the chapel lot. This weekly operation of her driving to the chapel\nlot to arrive at 3:15 is a coordinated human operation. Unfortunately, while\nvisiting I have often noticed loneliness from a portion of the residents. It is\nunlikely that they all have regular visitors. Gordon Alzheimer’s Buddies is not\nlarge enough to provide company to all of them; there are only 20 of us total. Some\nprobably do not have relatives regularly visit. This results in an\ninsufficiency of the good of company because there are not enough people with\nthe regularly coordinated action of visiting with patients at EPRC. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There\nare three conditions for the coordination of human operations: habits (of mind,\nwill, and skill), institutions, and material equipment. Cognitional habits of\nthe staff are heavily depended on, as the cognition of the residents is often\nlow, or some bit of it is malfunctioning, requiring the greater memory of\nnurses, etc. The nurses must know what sort of foods different residents\nrequire to eat, if they did not know what kind of food was needed, there could\nbe people fed hard food, who need soft food, who end up choking on the thicker\nfood. This cognitional habit is direly important, because without it, people\ncould choke, then experience trauma and harm. I have not seen this problem in\nthose working at Essex park. Unfortunately, in looking at other staff’s\ncognitional skills I realize an absence. The secretary does not seem to know\nhow to properly greet guests into the center. When our group walks in, most\ntimes the secretary looks at us, then refocuses her attention on the work she\nis doing, without greeting us and asking if we need assistance. He is young,\nlooks 16, and perhaps has not been trained to greet visitors, and thus does not\nknow how, making this a cognitional issue, not a volitional issue. Volitional\nhabits—whether or not people desire to perform needed tasks, are good in my and\nsome other residents’ desire to meet others. The people present at the home do\nnot spend much time desiring to meet others. The man whom I accompany, Frank, almost\nweekly makes an effort to greet another resident, or learn their name. This\nvolition is good because Frank’s choice to meet others cultivates an\nenvironment at EPRC where residents feel welcomed and embraced. What does not\nmake residents feel welcomed is an irritable staff member. An activities\nassistant who works onh the floor where I visit with Frank. This is an open\narea where there are tables, chairs, a television, and often the woman who\norganizes these events at times is not patient with the residents. A woman was\ncrying, and she came over and yelled at her to quiet down. The distortion of\nthese volitional habits comes when there is a lack of patience in the employee.\nSkills of those involved in this corporation include working with helping\npeople get in and out of bed. The nurses who are trained by hospitals and\nmedical programs delicately remove and insert people into their beds. Without\nthis skill, people would not be able to move around as much, thus suffocating\npeople in their own rooms for long amounts of time.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>An\ninstitution is the use of name tags for volunteers and workers. Everyone who\nworks as a part of Essex park requires a name tag with photo of the volunteer.\nThis is an institution because it is a habit required of all, a regular\noccurrence and obligation of those working there. However, another aspect of\ninstitutions apply to individual residents and their medicine schedule. Those\nwith a need for <i>x</i> pill <i>y</i> times per day have their own\ninstitutions help kept by the nurses. Even though these institutions are not\nheld by all in this community, it is a regular, ordered practice of\nindividuals, and two people at least partake in these events most times, at\nleast a nurse and resident. On the converse Training volunteers is an\ninstitution. It is performed in a certain way no matter who is doing it. There\nare certain aspects of it which ought to be present whenever someone is\nteaching it.&nbsp;In the training we received, there was a&nbsp;minuscule\namount of education on how to interact with the patient. Hearing about this\neducational piece of the&nbsp;program is part of what drew me to it,\nhowever,&nbsp;I have been let down by a teaching that did not extend much\nfurther than accompany and listen to them.&nbsp;I would have appreciated\nknowing more about how to respond when the residents we work with do not have a\ngood memory of their past, or when they cry, or are upset by not knowing the\npast, or how to react when they seem&nbsp;inconsistent, or to be making things\nup. Having more situational teaching in the&nbsp;preparation would have better\nprepared trainees to interact well with their residents, and now&nbsp;I don’t\nhave a regular time in which I have the chance to ask questions about these\nsorts of things. There is not a set time in which I can ask the staff how to\nreact.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMaterial equipment involved in Essex Park includes wheel chairs, items for\nresidences, rooms that people are to live in, the building itself. The wheel\nchair allows certain residents who cannot walk the ability to easily move\naround or be moved around. I took Frank out onto the patio, and could not have\ndone so without a wheel chair. This object allows people mobility, and without\nit many would be left, stuck in the mud of their rooms, glued to their beds,\nbecause many of these people have lost the strength to walk. However, EPRC lacks\nan easily wheelchair accessible doorway. I escorted Frank out onto the patio\nthe other week, but alone I could not hold open door and wheelchair him out, a\nnurse had to come out and help me. Without an accessible door, more people must\nbe involved in taking residents onto the patio, distracting nurses from other\ntasks they must do. If nurses’ work is less distracted, they can tend to more\npatients who need their expertise.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The\nstatus of head nurse has been assigned to Inchu, and this flows out of her\nhabits. She knows how to make decisions regarding patient treatment, she wants\nto do this well, and she has developed the skill of making good decisions, and\ndoing the necessary associated communication. Lonergan describes the evil\nrelated to personal status as that which arises when people are without\npersonal status—this could come from certain people not having any sort of\nrelation to others. The heart of personal status lies within the way one\ninteracts with others. Those with different habits will appropriately enter\ninto different roles of personal status, but innapropriately into roles that\nthey should not be presented with. The patients do not have much personal\nstatus as far as power or influence is concerned, but they do have status, as\npatients, and if they are presented as people without statuses, then there is\nevil. I have not identified any residents who are not being given the respect\nand treatment due to patients. One week I witnessed an activities assistant\nyell at a resident who was on the verge of tears. The woman kept repeating the\nsame thing over and over, and the assistant’s response made the woman more\nupset. The woman was not sitting down as requested by the assistant, but there\nmust have been a way to do this that garned less upsetness in the patient. A\ndeficiency in assigned personal status is the woman who receives us does not\nhave the professional skills needed to greet us well. Linda does not\nprofessionally greet us. She does not greet us with handshakes. It seems as\nthough she doesn’t have too much concern for our professionalism of signing in.\nThat may however have been attributed to the fact that we imposed the sign in\nprocess, or perhaps Inchu proposed it, and we simply followed along to tell\nLinda upstairs that we ought to have the same there. That is a lack of good in\nthe order because Linda and Inchu are not communicating as well as they could.<br\nclear=all style='mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always'>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Transcendental Precepts and the Development\nof the Subject: The Expansion of Our Concerns</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What separates\nmaturity from childhood? One aspect is the scope of what one cares about.\nToddlers become self aware, and their world of cares and concerns expands no\nfurther than their own satisfactions. Over time, if they grow into maturity,\ntheir cares will grow, as well as their acting out the transcendental. At\nleast, this is what should happen. These precepts I will list and define; I\nwill take time to explain, and then I will go on to lay out the argument, the\nproposal for action, the set policy in order to coerce others into, to explore\nthoughts and reflections on what is required to live into these. I will lay out\nsome key suggestions that give answer to the problem of, how does one come into\nexpanding their, as Lonergan describes, horizon of concerns. My suggestions\nare: encountering the beauty of a higher good, realizing that one is capable of\ncaring for these bigger things, and not bound by the way they view themselves,\ntheir self-perspective of what they ought to and can do. I will suggest what is\nneeded to live into these precepts, then explore how they might affect my moral\ndevelopment. Finally, I will give personal policy on how I can take\nresponsibility, or ownership, how I can take into my own hands the exhortation\nI have received to develop “the good that is one’s concern.”</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I wonder what my\ncurrent concerns are. To learn this I paid attention one day to what most\npulled my attention. I noticed myself drawing attention to peoples’ physical\nappearances often over the past few days. Since the lecture in which we\ndiscussed the way our attention and senses are tuned to certain things we care\nabout, I have kept a sporadic journal, an occasional diary, listing things that\ndraw my senses, that fancy my imagination. I found breast and chest sizes to\ndraw my attention. Then I go through a process of asking why that person is\nthat way. Images of biological molecules and dna flood my mind. Also the\nthought of guys bench pressing very often.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Necessary to live\ninto these precepts is a capacity to realize what they are. One must be trained\nto have the pointed out in ones’ self, and then after that they can, they have\ntaken the first step towards actualizing their goals. The first precept, be\naware, calls us to listen in to what is going on around us. We ought to use our\nsenses and take in what is going on around us. Imagining is a way to generate\ndata from which we can identitfy patterns. Through being aware we ought to draw\nfrom both our senses and our imagination, and be careful to not become too\ncaught up in either, for that will lead us to base our conclusions in what is\nnot reality (if we’re overemphasizing the use of our imagination, leaving data\nfrom our senses behind). Be intelligent begs us to make sense of the data,\ndeveloping insights from that data. There will not be simply one insight we\ndraw from whatever data we have taken in, and in order to determine which of\nthese insights is true, we ought to exercise the next level of consciousness:\nbe rational. This precept exhorts us to take this variety of insights, weigh\nthem, check them against reality, and consider which one is true. When we have\ndone this, we result with a judgment. This judgment ought to be acted upon,\nresponded to, and this is the heart of the imperative, be rational. Ideally,\nthese precepts move us towards apprehending, choosing, and making the\ntranscendental notions of the good come into existence.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I can take\nresponsibility for developing my concern. I can begin by telling myself, this\nis why I am doing some particular type of work—because of a larger reason. A\nstudent can initially take a course and only do the problems with the\nmotivation of getting a passing grade, but if they are confronted with this\nline of thought that informs one to have a bigger perspective, they can begin\nto develop their perspective by simply initiating their thought on what makes\nfor an appropriately larger concern. They might think, well, I want to do this\nhomework for the larger goal of getting my degree. They may then talk with a\nmentor and ask how they can have a better, more mature, more, bigger, better, more\nsignificant and meaningful of a reason to do this homework. The mentor may\nsuggest that ultimately there can be taking part in a college community where\nthey are part of a group of people who are working well and performing to the\npoint of excellence in this college setting. Later, in reflection, one may\naggrandize and extend this logical direction of reasoning, to realize that they\nwant to be part of a country which yields excellent students, and he must do\nhis bit in the little tasks to make this huge overall goal happen.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>These larger goals\nrequire an element of humility, which is part of what having a Christian\nperspective enables one to do so clearly. The task of the Christian is to be\nhumble, as James Gustafson elucidated in his introduction to R. H. Niebuhr’s <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Responsible Self</i>, “The proper stance\nof the Christian community in its ethical reflection is self-criticism and\nrepentance, not pride and aggrandizement.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'\nhref=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[2]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nHere we are doing ethical reflection, because the question at hand is what we\nshould do and who we should be.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Required for\nreflection is insights. We can ask about what our concerns ought to be, and how\nthey can be developed. Even through the non-stop writing process of\nbrainstorming, one will develop and realize ideas that can be used to guide\nthem in bounding forwards in this pattern of work to grow one’s heart\ndirection. In writing the paragraph with the illustration of the student, as I\nwalked through that illustration, there was a moment when the insight struck\nme, humility is a necessary part of how to actualize this desired goal.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How can I go\nthrough moral development? An expansion of what I care and am concerned about?\nI have observed this shift in myself the past few weeks as we have discussed\nthis topic in class. I have for quite a while longed to expand my horizon of\nconcern from India and that dating relationship to broader things. I have had a\npattern of forming relationships that became the center of my world. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The summer of 2011\nlearned to call this attitude towards dating idolatry, which was the summer\nafter my junior year. I listened to many Timothy Keller sermons, in one he\nincluded much discussion on what makes for idols.<a style='mso-footnote-id:\nftn3' href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[3]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nHe used the image of a centerpiece, and asked, “What is the centerpiece of your\nlife?” I immediately thought of dating relationships as the center, but that\nsummer I was convinced that I was switching foci from dating to God. More\nrecently I have realized that the horizon of my concern was with others’\nopinions, what I often call “people pleasing”. This could more precisely be\ndefined as the fear of man, or being primarily or having utmost concern for\nothers’ opinions of me.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How did my\nconcerns develop from this to the greater perspective which is involved in the\ncares of larger problems such as pursuing a large problem that fills God’s\npurposes in the world rather than smaller individual problems of a\nrelationship.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I have seen moral\ndevelopment happen in myself over the course of my career as a resident\nadvisor. At first, my concern for keeping the rules and so forth stemmed from\nme simply wanting to do what I had to, to fulfill my contract, but since, my\nconcern has grown to the point where now I care about having a certain degree\nof concern about how the overall environment of Fulton is. I want this to be a\nplace where people have comfort going into their rooms and their suitemates’\nrooms, never afraid of walking in on people having sex, what could be a\njarring, even traumatizing incident. Another thing I care about is maintaining\nan environment in which residents can sleep, study, and enjoy time together.\nThat is the large mission of what the dorms are supposed to be.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Where does this\nshift come from? How does it happen? What caused this development in my moral\nstatus? What broadened my horizon? During Elijah Project lecture dDr. Carmer\nillustrated an example which had a car in it. We were explaining what it means\nto have a circle of cares and concerns. Driving is a precarious endeavor, and\npart of it involves learning to maintain a certain type of location, a certain\natmosphere to one’s location. One can drive safely simply to not be harmed, or\none can drive safely because they want to be part of a town in which has safe\ndriving. This is a maturing, an expanding of one’s care. It goes from care that\nreaches only to self, to a care that extends throughout all of a community at\nlarge. When Dr. Carmer described this, it hit me with a moment of beauty and\nawe.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[4]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Perhaps this\nmoment is when I began to shift towards wanting to have this beautifully larger\nperspective for myself.

Through interactions with people who have a larger perspective on\nlife one will be advised to come to a larger perspective. Finally, these judgments\nare to be apprehended, acted on so that they can usher in the good that they\nare understood to bring in. I can respond to my judgments by acting on them. I\nhave decided that there are some true ways in which one can incarnate the good.\nI have apprehended how to achieve the good, I now ought to make choices which\nreflect my greater concern, and allow me to take on traits which bring me into\nfull humanity.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I choose how to\nspend time, and as such, I ought to choose to spend time reflecting on how I\ncan expand my concerns.

Simply observing them will lead me to learn how to act in such a\nway that cares about bigger things. A care of mine is underserved access to\nmedical insurance, through taking time to learn about this more, I will expand\nthe amount of care I have for the topic. But learning more about the topic by\nitself will not lead me to learn and develop a deeper drive to work towards\nthis issue. As I learn more and more, greater problems should arise to me as I\ngather insights about this topic. Through realizing greater problems, a deeper\ncall of responsibility will be placed on me. If this is my chosen field of specialty,\nthen I ought to respond to the problems which I learn are the most significant.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>At the end, I\nlearn to more avidly take on what it is to be human. God created people to live\nout what Lonergan has identified as the transcendental precepts. Through spending\ntime with people who have a larger perspective on live, who are maturely\nmorally developed, through being taken aback—having an awe moment regarding the\nbeauty of an expanded care, through taking times to deliberately reflect on how\none can move their set of concerns, first realizing where it currently is, then\npondering over how it can be expanded, we grow in our understanding of where\nour concerns ought to be. Through reflection we apprehend where our cares\nshould lie, and then, this requires a final step of responsibility. Once we\nhave apprehended what we must do to expand our moral foundation, then we must\nchoose to act on the things which will expand our moral horizon. Further\nthought conducted on my cares, especially those subconscious, would reveal my\nconcerns.
