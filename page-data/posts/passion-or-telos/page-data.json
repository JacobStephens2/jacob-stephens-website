The question, “What should I\ndecide?” has existed throughout human history. Identifying free choice as\nextant exists in postmodern and ancient thought. Further, postmoderns and\nancients have expressed what constitutes a good decision. Sources older than\nChrist do not discourse on the influence of Christian theology on decision-making.\nThere are nuanced differences in these suggested ways of decision making\nthough. The theme of this essay is choice. Plato and Kierkegaard both describe\nchoice as existent and consequential, unlike. They differ in claims about what\ncriteria hold the most weight when making a decision. Plato holds that the\nright decision is more important than making that choice with passion, while\nKierkegaard’s attitude towards choice is that passionately choosing is more\nimportant than right decision.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Plato\nas well as Kierkegaard believed in the existence of choice. I’m transitioning\ninto a section where I will draw out similarities in Kierkegaard and Plato’s\nexistence of choice as well as their belief in its consequences. The purpose of\nthis section is to provide background information. This information will help\nus realize that Kierkegaard and Plato not only contrast in their understanding\nof choice, but they also have strong similarities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>In\nPlato’s <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Republic</i>,<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\"> </i>he illustrates only characters who believe in choice; this is the\nmajor premise. Hacker and Sommers define deductive reasoning in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">A Writer’s Reference</i>; here I will use\nthe logic described there in order to draw the conclusion that Plato himself\nbelieves in choice (96)<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">. </i>From the\nmajor premise we can draw a deductive conclusion stating that Plato himself\nbelieves in choice. As Pojman and Vaughn summarize, the second chapter of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Republic</i> narrates Glaucon and Adeimantus\ndemanding from Socrates a justification of doing morality for its own sake (Plato\n131).<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">  </span>Glaucon provides a specific case\nof one of Plato’s characters who believes in choice. This case can serve as a\nminor premise we can apply to the major premise. Looking a bit into the first\nportion of the text, Glaucon explains the “origin … of morality” (133). One of\nthe details in his description is about people who made the first laws, and it\nreads as follows, “they decide that the most profitable course is for them to\nenter a contract with one another” (133). Glaucon’s acknowledgement of these persons’\ndecision to make laws is an acknowledgement of people’s freedom to make\nchoices. There is no deterministic or fatalistic attitude here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Kierkegaard\nillustrates choice’s existence. “Concerning Unscientific Postscript” provides a\ncase illustrating a scenario which involves choice. At the beginning of the\nexcerpt included in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Classics</i>,\nKierkegaard, as paints a scene where Johannes Climacus, “born in this city”\ninquires, “how may I establish a proper relationship to Christianity?” (944).\nHis interest is on the verge of acting in response to whatever action he takes,\nand in his attitude, I interpret a choice of his to establish this\nrelationship. University of Rhode Island professor Bob Zunjic interprets the\nmeaning of part of the title, “Concluding”, to be that Kierkegaard was\n“announc[ing] the end of his activity as a literary author.” This is\nsignificant because it signals that this work was a major writing of his, and\nas such, he likely wrote into Johannes Climacus major attitudes that reflected\nperspectives he found true including one we are examining. That choice exists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Kierkegaard\nand Plato argued from an understanding of choice as something which has\nconsequences, and as a result, the importance of making good decisions\nincreases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Plato\nconveys that choice is consequential, as seen in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">Phaedo</i>. As Pojman and Vaughn point out, Socrates attempts to\nconvince Phaedo of afterlife (69). In the course of their dialogue, Socrates says\nthings which evidence that he believed choices in this life affect our state in\nafterlife. He goes on to discuss with Simmias and Crito about how the soul is\nall that will extend on into the afterlife, and that intellectual activity has\nthe capacity to improve peoples’ situations (71). If they are discussing what\nmakes for a better life, they are implying the availability of the capacity to\nchoose in such a way that life following those choices is different.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Kierkegaard\nconveys that choice is consequential, as seen in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">Sickness Unto Death</i>. At the beginning of chapter 1, he posits that\n“[m]an is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the\neternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a\nrelation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self. … If on the\ncontrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the\npositive third term, and this is the self.” Here we can see that there is the\npotential for man to not be a self, but on a particular condition– “the\nrelation relat[ing] itself to its own self … this is the self” then the subject\nbecomes a self. But a choice must be made by that subject in order to relate\nitself to its own self, otherwise they will stay in the first state described\nby Kierkegaard, where “man is not yet a self.” The consequence of a “relation\nrelat[ing] itself to its own self” is that it becomes a self. Based on this\nevidence, I make a probable, inductive truth claim that Kierkegaard, through\nthe pseudonym Anti-Climacus, reveals the perspective of choice with\nconsequence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Although\nKierkegaard and Plato have, in the broad strokes I have painted, similar\nbeliefs about choice, they also have differing beliefs about choice. My central\nclaim in this next section is that these two authors allude to different\nprinciples as that which ought to hold the highest priority in decision making.\nKierkegaard holds to passion as a major characteristic of decisions that ought\nbe most highly praised, and Plato holds to alignment with Telos as the most\npraiseworthy aspect of decisions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">When Plato has\ncharacters make decisions based on the good, he is advocating for people to\nmake decisions based on good. Here is a generalization which will be followed\nby specific cases of it, and finally a deductive conclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">In Plato’s<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\"> Apology</i>, Socrates accepts his\npunishment because it is good for his soul. The good is the highest goal here\nfor Socrates. Even if Socrates felt more passionate about rejecting his\npunishment, his choice is better because of the fact that he decided something\nin pursuit of the good.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">In Plato’s <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Crito</i>, Socrates accepts his punishment\nbecause subverting the Law would harm his soul, and thus, whether or not he\npassionately decides or passively decides, the right decision is determined\nteleologically, with the goal of a pure soul.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Based on these\npremises, we deductively concluded that Plato himself advocates that people in\ngeneral should make decisions based on what will move them towards the Good.<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\"> </i>We cannot reason inductively to this\nstatement, because in no specific cases do we see Plato directly advocating for\npeople to make decisions based on good, we only see him glorify a character who\nmake decisions based on the good, so we need to establish a premise that allows\nus to jump from these specific cases to this deductive conclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Next, I will\npresent and respond to two counterarguments to the claim that Plato most\npraised decisions which moved towards Telos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Although Ancients\nwere concerned with having desire to act virtuously, even in order to make an\nact virtuous, as seen in “Nicomachean Ethics”, it does not follow from that\nobservation that Socrates thought the same way about virtue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Even if one does\nconclude that Socrates thought the same way as Aristotle about what comprised a\nvirtuous act, as you presented in class this semester, one of the requiring\naspects of a virtuous action is that the person doing it desires to do it. Even\nso, the action is more important than the desire, because in order to come to a\nstate where our desires have been cultivated in such a way as to want to do\nwhat is excellent. The good action precedes the cultivation of the desire, and\ntherefore the action itself is more important overall than the desire for good\naction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Switching back to\nour postmodern author on dock, Kierkegaard says what matters more in a person’s\ndecision is that they made it with vigor than that they made it according to\ntruth. Making decisions according to truth is critical to Kierkegaard, but he gives\npreference the passionate decision to decision in line with truth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">In <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Either/Or II</i>, there is claim of\npassionate decision being more important than right or wrong decision, than\nvirtuous decision. The reason why is as follows, “if a man were to choose the\nwrong, he will nevertheless <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">discover,\nprecisely by reason of the energy with which he chose, that he had chosen the\nwrong</i>” (Kierkegaard 944). Kierkegaard values the right, as we see at the\nend of this statement, but what he values more is when someone acts with great\nenergy and personal investment, because then they will find out if they were\nwrong.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:200%\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">            </span>Our\nclass discussed the example of the theologian who has all of his doctrines\ncorrect yet has not <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">chosen </i>to act on\nthem. We also discussed this briefly in our meeting to go over my outline. This\ntheologian who <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">knows</i> abundant truth,\nyet, as Steven Garber illustrates in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">The\nFabric of Faithfulness</i>, does not put legs to those ideas, ends up living a\nless, as Greg Carmer described in the Elijah Project final paper prompt,\nmeaningful life, than the person who is gungho active about their truths, yet\nis wrong in many cases about the truths they believe. That person’s life ends\nup more meaningful than the theologian who knows much, but appropriates little.\nFor a few of the SOC310 classes I missed over the last few weeks of the\nsemester I chose with great passion <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">not </i>to\ngo to them. I was very conscious that this was a choice I was making, and that\nI was exchanging going to that class for a tad more time to work on my final\nElijah Project essay. Looking back, I’ve discovered that this was a poor\nchoice. I acted on the conviction that it would be good to skip class, because\nwe must sacrifice loyalty to some commitment in order to invest in another of\nour commitments with excellence. But I have, in wake of these skips, discovered\nthe more true bit of wisdom that we mustn’t always sacrifice loyalty to some\ncommitment in order to invest excellently in another one. If we first commit\nourselves to fewer things, such that our workload is manageable, less skimps on\ncommitments will be called for in pursuit of excellence in a particular station\nof life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">In James Flynn’s\nsecond chapter of <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">A Very Brief\nIntroduction to Existentialism</i>, this expert in philosophy summarizes\nKierkegaard’s three stages of becoming an individual. Princeton professor\nWalter Lowrie prefers to translate the stages as spheres. Moving from the\naesthetic sphere of existence to the ethical sphere requires a choice. Because\nthe choice precedes the movement into the ethical sphere, it is more important\nthan which ethical sphere one chooses to occupy. Without choice, we could not\nenter the ethical sphere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Kierkegaard takes\nthis emphasis on passion because of being a Christian. His being a Christian\ncaused him to put emphasis on the individual, as seen by Climacus in <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i>. “For\nChristianity places enormous significance on my little self” (944).\nFurthermore, Climacus mentions that, “the only unpardonable sin against the\nmajesty of Christianity is for an individual to take his relationship to it for\ngranted”, which implies a sense of required ownership being advocated here.\nClimacus is saying that we ought not take our relationship to Christianity for\ngranted, and what that requires is taking it as our own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">In conclusion,\nKierkegaard finds personal investment in decision making more important than\nhaving a decision that most reflects truth, while Plato finds the opposite.<br style=\"mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always\" clear=\"all\">\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;\nline-height:200%\" align=\"center\">Works Cited</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in\">Carmer, Greg.\n“Final Integrative Paper Prompt.” Fall 2014.
