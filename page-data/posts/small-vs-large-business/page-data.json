class=WordSection1>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Mrs. Shirk</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Graduation Project</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Nearly\nhalf of all American businesses fail in the first two years of startup (Campbell).<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So why work for a supposedly less ‘stable’\nsmall business when you could work for a more ‘stable’ large business?<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why shop at a smaller store with potentially\nhigher prices, when you could potentially save some money at a larger chain\nstore?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although prices at a local\nretailer may be higher, the benefits of shopping there as opposed to a large\nchain store outweigh this detraction because of better quality service and\nhigher quality products.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In\nrecent times smaller companies have been having a harder time keeping up and\nrunning, largely because they just can’t keep up with large chain stores often\nputting their entire stores on clearance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> \n</span>Many big box retailers went into full clearance mode during this past\nChristmas season (Hurlburt).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However,\nthese clearance sales can’t last forever.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> \n</span>Another factor of these clearances is that large chain stores are\nclearly not making nearly as much profit per sale as the smaller retailers are (therefore\nthe employees are potentially paid less, according to various possible\ncircumstances).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unless, however, the\nquantity of products sold yield enough profit to keep that pay at its usual\nlevel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, something that comes\nwith these sales is higher quantity, this higher quantity yields more\nprofit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This can tend to even itself out.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Higher prices yield fewer sales, while lower\nprices tend to yield more sales.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Small\nor independent retailers simply can no longer compete with sales prices.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As online shopping allows easy comparison of\nbranded goods, and as EBay allows more focused niches.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Small and independent retailers need\nsomething different, something other than an advantage in price.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“The Internet is a great provider of product\ninformation, but it can never replicate the value of a customer&#8217;s interaction\nwith a highly knowledgeable salesperson.” (Hurlburt).<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is largely what separates the small or\nindependent retailers from the rest of the pack.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This salesperson can also demonstrate or\nallow the customer to test out a certain product or service.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reading on the internet could provide a\nrecommendation to a general audience of people, but a highly knowledgeable\nsalesperson can recommend a specific product tailored to an individual\ncustomer’s needs.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>People\nwant to obtain things easily, as outlined by staple’s easy button.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They want compelling presentations, and\ncaptivating experiences. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They want to be\nentertained, and for their senses to be driven.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> \n</span>These are all things that a convenient, small retailer can provide.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a smaller store, employees are more easily\naccessed, and products are more easily found, however, this also leads to less\nproducts being available.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Smaller\nstores often offer a tighter niche.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They\noffer fewer genres of products, but more products of one specific genre.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These stores appeal and build around the\ncustomer for whom price is not as much of an object.<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These customers can be <span class=GramE>more\n‘picky’</span> but they are customers none the less.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In\nthe end however, the one thing you cannot forget is your family, your personal\nlife.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your life comes before your\nbusiness, you wouldn’t want to miss your son or daughter’s childhood, lose\nrelationships with your friends, or for your relationship with your spouse to\n‘decompose’ over time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A man who lives\nand loves his family or his life is a happy worker, he has friends at the small\nbusiness he works for, and he has support from them. <span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>If complementing groups of workers (<span\nclass=GramE>i.e.</span> customer service and product development, etc.) are set\nto work together, natural leaders will emerge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> \n</span>These groups of happy workers will work well together, and will drive\nthe customer’s emotion, giving them the captivating experience that keeps the\ncustomers attracted to the uniquity of small businesses.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n","title":"Small versus large business","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob
