Laurence A. Savett, M.D. ~320pg. I recommend this\nbook because it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>teaches</i> how to\ncompassionately interact with patients, highly valuing them as people with\nstories rather than as cases to be solved.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gifted\nHands</i>. Ben Carson, M.D. ~200pg.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I\nrecommend this book because it inspired me to continue after medicine despite\nmy lack of self-confidence in my ability to become a physician. Carson was not\nthe most naturally intelligent person in his classes, but he became the most\ndiligent student, and in med school, a very curious student about neuroscience,\nboth of these qualities lead him to become a ground-breaking physician.<span\nclass=msoIns><ins cite=\"mailto:Craig%20Story\" datetime=\"2013-12-28T09:23\"><o:p></o:p></ins></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>______________________________________________________________________</i></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>1. Describe your 2 best qualities?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One,\nI am skilled at getting to know people quickly. I have developed this skill by\ncuriosity to get to know others as well as value them by hearing their story. I\nfrequently try to learn how to do this even better by reflecting on my\nconversations with people. Usually this involves my journaling out something\nthey shared with me about themself.<span class=msoIns><ins\ncite=\"mailto:Craig%20Story\" datetime=\"2013-12-28T09:24\"><o:p></o:p></ins></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Two,\nI am skilled at confronting others. In my position as resident advisor at\nGordon college confronting others about being too noisy, or about a conflict\nthey have with another person on the floor was part of my responsibility. At\nthe end of the semester anonymous comments in my resident advisor evaluation\ndescribed me as skilled at confrontation.<span class=msoIns><ins\ncite=\"mailto:Craig%20Story\" datetime=\"2013-12-28T09:24\"><o:p></o:p></ins></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>2. Tell me about your 2 weakest\npoints?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One,\nsometimes I have difficulty completing administrative tasks on time. Through\ncollege my professors met with me and told me that I am intelligent but need to\nbe more diligent in handing things in on time. This is the biggest factor that\nhas brought my grades down. I am working to improve this with a detailed\napproach to time management and meeting with an academic psychologist to\nschedule better.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Two,\nI can get spontaneously distracted from tasks I’m working on, such as a piece\nof homework writing, or when I’m walking somewhere on a schedule, but then\nbecome caught up in a conversation with someone. This is a good and a bad\nthing. It is bad because I end up late to certain appointments, but it is good\nbecause sometimes these spontaneous interactions prove important to support\nsomeone or help out in a moment of need.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>3. What exposures have you had to\nthe medical profession?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I\nhave been regularly a patient at a family practice throughout my life. Two\nsummers ago, I developed a bump on my forehead. Investigating what it was took\ntrips all summer to various medical practitioners, from X-ray operators, to CAT\nscan operators, and back to my physician multiple times through that summer.\nThe bump turned out to be a baby tooth sized osteoma – an extra bit of bone on my\nskull, a benign tumor. A plastic surgeon excised the osteoma and brought my\nforehead back to an appearance where I consistently felt comfortable putting my\nhair up. Previously, I occasionally wanted to keep bangs down to cover the\nbump. That summer I developed more familiarity with the medical profession due\nto my increased time with medical practitioners and my budding interest in\nmedicine.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;line-height:150%'>Also, I was\ntrained to volunteer as a compassionate care giver at a hospital in a city\nnearby my <span class=GramE>home town</span>. I am going to volunteer for <span\nclass=GramE>this fifty hours</span> over this winter break in the emergency\ncenter.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>4. How would you describe the\nrelationship between science and medicine? Why does “evidence-based medicine” sometimes\ncause controversy?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Science,\nwhich is physical, can be used to practice better medicine, which is physical\nand spiritual. Science often has a less human side to it, but it can be focused\non humans in order to inform the practice of medicine. I see science as pushing\nmedicine forward to become better.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Evidence-based\nmedicine causes controversy because physicians rely on long used <span\nclass=GramE>methods</span> they have seen work to prescribe cures, but\nsometimes these cures might not be supported by primary research. Also, there\nmay be conflicts between physicians as to how to treat a certain symptom. Also,\nDr. David N. Mahooti, MD, a Massachusetts family doctor and one of the visiting\nspeakers in my health seminars class at Gordon College, mentioned prescribing\ntreatment that is placebic when patients come in without a substantial problem.\nHe feels that he must give them something in return for their visit.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>5. What aspects of working in the\nhealth professions do you think would most influence you personally, both in\nthe directions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The\naspect of daily working with (really, living with) people who are suffering\nwould influence me in such a way that I am satisfied in knowing that I am doing\nincredibly necessary work.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The\naspect of routine, doing the same processes, and beginning to feel like the\nwork is one patient after another, and never having variety could lead me to\ndissatisfaction. Laurence A. Savett, M.D. comforts me in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>The Human Side of Medicine </i>though by saying that gathering the\nentirely unique stories of every different person leads to interesting, always\nchanging days. Even though the treatment might often be the same, the story\nwill always be different. I want to take this ideal viewpoint. I would miss not\nhaving research, figuring out new things, and letting my intense curiosity for\nhow physical systems work discover. </p>\n\n</div>\n\n","title":"Health Professions Mock Interview: Part One","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/autobiography/","name":"Autobiography"},{"link":"/posts/category/health/","name":"Health"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"Revised OSHA Hazard Communication Standard Certification","uri":"/posts/osha-hazard-communication-standard-certification/"},"prevPost":{"title":"Creation With a Mind of its Own: God Created Species Using Evolution","uri":"/posts/creation-with-a-mind-of-its-own/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":536,"nextId":650,"prevId":638}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
