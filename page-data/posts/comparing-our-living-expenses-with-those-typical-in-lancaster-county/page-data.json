I expected this value to be higher. However, I suppose our apartment is pretty nice. Housing was the only cost and comparison that surprised me however. I already thought we spent less than average on food ( due to my non-processed raw diet and Kendel Lyn&#8217;s grocery thrift). I expected our transportation to be lower given that I work from home, and I thought our health expenses would be lower given Franklin &amp; Marshal College&#8217;s excellent healthcare plan for their employees. Miscellaneous I also thought would be higher, given that we (especially me), spend a bit more than we need on non-essentials, such as games, books, and decorations.</p>\n","title":"Comparing Our Living Expenses with Those Typical in Lancaster County, PA","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/business/","name":"Economics"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"Remove YouTube Recommended VideosÂ Plugin","uri":"/posts/remove-youtube-recommended-videos-plugin/"},"prevPost":{"title":"Reading of The Bremen Town Musicians","uri":"/posts/bremen-town-musicians/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":383,"nextId":338,"prevId":398}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
