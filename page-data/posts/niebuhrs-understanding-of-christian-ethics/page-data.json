Gordon’s classes are riddled with Christian ethics. Ethics is not only\nwhat we should do, but what is good and wrong, and therefore an outflow\nquestion of this is what do we do to attain that good and avoid that wrong that\nwe now understand to be right and wrong. This paper will explore the theology\nof the Christian ethics of H. Richard Niebuhr, particularly his ethical\nimperative to the cathekontic, or the most fitting response, as opposed to\nethical imperatives to the teleological, to the end of goodness, or the\ndeontological, to actions which themselves are good, then I interact with the\ntheologian’s argument by comparing and contrasting this with my own growing\ntheological perspective.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“All\ngood theology ends in ethics”, says a professor who Dr. Robert Green, my\nChristian Theology professor, had. In Wayne Grudem’s tome of a text, <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to\nBiblical Doctrine</i>, every chapter of the book ends with section entitled\n“Questions for Practical Application”, encouraging thought in direction towards\nthe way we should live in response to the assertions contained in the preceding\nchapters. In one of the statements in one of these chapters we can identify the\nunderlying assumptions about what is good based on what action the author\nencourages. “God wants us to pray because prayer expresses our trust in God”.<a\nstyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\"><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[7]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nIf one has the belief that satisfying God’s desires is good, then the following\nquestion is, what does God desire me to do? That way the person can decide to\nact in accordance with their belief about what God desires them to do. In this\nquote, the ethical imperative that follows is to pray. Why? Because God wants\nus to. Why does God want us to pray? Because prayer expresses our trust in God.\nThe examination of this statement about prayer reveals on the heart of ethics.\nWhat is good? Then, how do I act to attain that good? </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Responsible Self, </i>Niebuhr lays out\nthree symbols humans have used to conceive of themselves: man-the-citizen,\nman-the-maker, and man-the-answerer. These symbols each have ethical\nimplications. If man is a citizen, what he should do is follow the law,\notherwise his identity is threatened (what I’m wondering though is how identity\nbeing threatened becomes bad, I suppose in this instance simply by the desire\nto stay within the definition one has taken on as man-the-citizen). If a man is\na creator, what he should do is create various steps in order to attain the\nvision he has set out in his mind, or to attain the goal he has set. The people\nwho primarily think of man as a law-abider define the good by what is right,\nwhile those who think of man primarily as maker define the right as that which\npropels one towards the good. Man-the-answerer is set as the third symbol used\nto conceive of humanity, which in turn aids in decision making. This symbol has\nman answering to his environment—what is going on around me? What is the most\nfitting response to my particular situation? It is a response that takes into\naccount its environment as well as the effect it will have after it has been\nenacted.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In\nJoseph Bush’s review of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Responsible\nSelf</i>, he discloses four aspects of responsibility: responsiveness,\ninterpretation, social solidarity, and accountability.<a style='mso-footnote-id:\nftn8' href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[8]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nThese are four aspects Niebuhr uses to define responsibility. Niebuhr says they\nfall within that concept. Responsiveness is that an action that is responsible\nmust be a response to the action of another person. Interpretation, meaning\nthat we find meaning and interpret the meaning of various actions that we\nencounter in the world. So if I see someone talking, using words like, “Father,\nplease help me get through this separation between my friend and I”, then I’ll\nwonder, hmmm… They’re praying, and that means that they’re talking to God. God\nis hearing them. That’s an example of interpreting another’s action.\nResponsible action has accountability, in the sense that it is going to affect\nothers, and in trying to make a decision we realize that it’s going to affect\nanother. If I free write this whole essay, then submit it without revising\nspelling errors, whether or not I anticipated the way that that lack of\nrevision would affect my grade determines whether or not my action was\naccountable. It will be accountable though because someone else is going to see\nit. Finally, in order for an action to be responsible, it must possess social\nsolidarity. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Niebuhr’s Ethics Match Scriptural Portrayal\nof Reality<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Niebuhr says that Christians should\ndo what is most fitting. He gives a basis for how to live the Christian life.\nI’m most interested in what beliefs about the good lie underneath of Niebuhr’s\nstatements about what we should do, and I have a hunch that I’ll begin to spill\nover into epistemology. If we can agree on what we know, and how we can know,\nthen we can develop a group of beliefs that are similarly known; we’ll come to\na common understanding of the good.

Sharon Ketcham, in the\nopening to my Christian Theology undergraduate course, described theology as\nthe place where faithful interpretation of life meets with living out life.\nTheological reflection seeks to understand what God’s redeeming activity in the\nworld is. Theology centers around God. I want this essay to focus on theology,\nand not just philosophy. It seems like a hard distinction for me to\nmake—between theology and philosophy. Philosophy asks what is right and wrong.<a\nstyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn10' href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\"><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[10]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nIts questions cannot be answered by science.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11'\nhref=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[11]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nTheology answers questions about and related to God, so if there is an ethical\nquestion related to God, that falls within the domain. Theology is “a religious\nbelief system about God or ultimate reality”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12'\nhref=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\" title=\"\"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span\nstyle='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[12]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>.\nTherefore, where this religious belief system has beliefs about what <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i> be done, that is ethical\ntheology. Grudem defines systematic theology as “any study that answers the\nquestion, ‘What does the whole Bible teach us today?’ about any given topic.”<a\nstyle='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href=\"#_ftn13\" name=\"_ftnref13\" title=\"\"><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[13]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>\nThere, theology answers particular questions about what the Bible teaches us\ntoday. This overlaps with McDonough’s view that theology answers questions\nabout what is, while Biblical studies answer questions about what was. They\nboth pertain to today’s reality.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Compared to my own\nunderstanding of what Christians should do (a seemingly theological,\nphilosophical question), this system seems quite abstract from reference to the\nBible. That’s what makes it seem so philosophical and not very theological.\nNiebuhr is not defending his ideas with reference to Scripture, but his is a\nChristian, and calling this study “Christian moral philosophy.” However, the\nideas he presents do relate to God. Man-the-answerer is a view of humanity that\nconceives man as one looking to answer things that are going on around him.\nThat’s a purely philosophical conception about the nature of man. Whether that\nis true or not, whether that’s really how man is or not falls into ontology and\nepistemology, what is and how do we know. But you could also come at it from a\ntheological perspective. What does the “whole Bible” teach us about the nature\nof man? (This ethical framework with the goal of acting responsibly is based in\na conception of man). God acted first, which fits into Niebuhr’s conception of\nman-as-answerer. Adam needed to answer an action that had been previously taken\non him, and that action taken on him partly determined what would ultimately be\nright and good for him. God said to obey, and that action taken on Adam played\ninto determining what was right and wrong. Disobedience would have been wrong.\nWhy? Because God warned Adam to do that. Warnings have something bad to them.\nAdam would learn of evil if he ate from the fruit of the tree of the knowledge\nof good and evil. That was disobedient, and therefore wrong, because God said\nto do so. What about God’s commands make disobedience to those commands wrong?\nNow we’re starting to feel the man-the-law-abider imagery. God made a law to\nnot eat, and therefore it was right to not eat, because that was the law. But\nwas it wrong to eat that fruit before God said so? Perhaps. Because maybe the\nfruit of the tree would have always been harmful to humans, but on the other\nhand, perhaps there was a moment when this act became wrong. Perhaps the moral\nnature of reality changes over time. I have an intuition that that may be a\ndangerous assertion. Or different parts of morality are revealed at different\ntimes. What about the fittingness of the act, in a specific time a particular\naction is very unique, because there is such grand difference in context for me\nmaking a decision in my kitchen vs. a hunter making a decision 3000 years ago\nin North America. There may be threads of moral law that carry on constantly\nthough. I’m looking for a basis for morality – is it conforming to God’s\ncharacter and commands? Niebuhr explicated a description of different ways\nhumans have conceived of themselves, and especially the ways that have oriented\nhuman ethical life. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So, after playing\nwith biblical origins of morality, we see these various images helping us\nunderstand portraits in Scripture, and these images help us understand how we\norient ourselves ethically today. I agree with Niebuhr’s models. I see them in\nreality.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What about his\nfour aspects of responsibility? They seem a description of what constitutes\nresponsible action. He doesn’t make the statement that we should do what is\nresponsible. But that seems assumed. I must believe that acting responsibly is\nin line with what is good. The underlying tone of the essay seems to be that\nresponsibility is good, and I’m curious how that shows through, where that can\nbe found in his writing—more explicit reference to responsible action being\ngood. He seems mostly to describe what is, as opposed to what should be but\nisn’t yet. The type of responsible action he describes: having social\nsolidarity, accountability, responsiveness, and interpretation. Each of these I\ncould look for examples of in Scripture, but again, that’s me looking to see if\nthis framework of reality he’s posing exists in Scripture. Does it jive with my\noperational theology? Or my operational philosophy about what constitutes\nresponsible action? The underlying assumption is that responsible action is\nsomething the Christian is called to. Where is that shown? In the title of the\nbook: “An Essay in Christian Moral Philosophy”. A moral philosophy is going to\ndescribe what exists that is good, and what follows from stating that something\nis good is figuring out how to attain that good, so even if he seems in a more\ndescriptive mode here than prescriptive, he’s still advocating for a particular\nkind of life. I agree with his description and positive valuation of\nteleological, deontological, and fitting response ethics, as well as his four\npart understanding of responsibility. From here on we could take his theory of\nethics and use it as a guiding principle for understanding and deciding how to\nact.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;\nline-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Most Fitting\nChurch<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What would it look\nlike for a church to take on his ethics of the most fitting? This church would\nfirst need to understand the symbol of man-the-answerer as a symbol which\naffects how people orient themselves in their decision making. Then an\nunderstanding of responsibility could be taught. As a practical lesson to what\nthese are, people would be urged to go out and think about a decision, now that\nthey’ve been acted on by an outside group, they have an opportunity to respond\nin the most fitting way. The ethics of the most fitting are a response to\nactions upon an agent, then those actions are interpreted, and the response\nanticipates the reaction of the world around him. It is accountable to those\nwhom one lives with, including the far reaches of this planet for some\ndecisions. Finally it is aware of its continued impact as a part of history, as\nan act of social solidarity, affecting a large group and number of people. This\nchurch would take on a character of more than rule following, but careful,\nsituational judging. They, like William Wilberforce, who spent two years\nconsidering committing to Christ before he did, would begin to take longer in\nweighing some decisions. Perhaps people they evangelize to would take more time\nto consider whether or not they want to commit to Jesus, like the deliberation\nthe story in Scripture paints, of a person who took time to consider how much\nit would cost to build a certain structure, or how his number of soldiers would\nfare against the soldiers of the opponent.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><br\nclear=all style='mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always'>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:\nnormal'>Bibliography<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>Bush, Joseph. “Review\nessay of Niebuhr&#8217;s The responsible self.
