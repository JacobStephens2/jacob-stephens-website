Prioritization is often a problem for me when doing\nschoolwork; often when doing homework, I’ll choose to do something that’s not\nimportant to do then, or for example, a reading that I don’t even need to do.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There\nare a number of factors that contribute to me procrastinating, which is\ncertainly a barrier to learning. I put off tasks to another day, especially\nbig, complicated ones. And when I do make a schedule, I can become discouraged\nwhen it is interrupted. Because I’m not very confident in my writing skills,\nand don’t have much experience writing, I tend to put off those assignments.\nI’ve just recently realized that I can be perfectionistic, and this negatively\naffects my attitude towards starting assignments. I dread them more because I\nwant to make them perfect, and that takes much more effort than the assignment\nactually needs.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I\nam a bit afraid of success. This is because neither of my parents went to\ncollege, so I feel a greater responsibility and weight to succeed; subtly, this\ndrives my desire to go into a liberal arts profession—a profession in which I\nmust have a credited bachelor’s degree to a apply to that professional school.\nI often think that if my expensive (my parents also don’t have a lot of money)\ncollege education does provide me with something concrete, like a degree that I\n<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>need</i> to go into <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>X </i>profession, then the money will have partly been wasted. I think\nthat the money is partially wasted because I think that I could learn what I\nlearn in college for free using the resources available to me, like the\nInternet, self-education, and sitting in on classes at colleges.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another\nreason I’m slightly afraid of succeeding is because I will enter a different\nvocational world than my parents, which I’m slightly afraid could distance me\nfrom them… intellectually, physically.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I\nalso have executive function disorder, which means that organizing, scheduling,\nand time and task management don’t come as naturally to me.

I need to realize that getting my work done\nsatisfactorily comes before getting my work done extraordinarily. Once I get\nthe work done just alright then I can adjust it to make it better. My work\ndoesn’t need to be exceptional every time, and it can’t be exceptional until it\nis first acceptable, from where I then move on to make it better. I’m building\nnew dreams and a new sense of possibility.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I’m\nalso afraid to fail, and that fear is increased by my lack of confidence in my\nacademic learning skills. However, I’m going to over come this by developing\nacademic learning skills with the LTL system—skills that comprise the most\nsuccessful learning system for college students. I’ve already seen this help me\nlearn. For example, while I was taking my OT exam, I specifically remembered\nstudying for some of the content with the making lecture note questions system.\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To\novercome the things that are harder for me, having executive function disorder,\nthe time management especially will help me to accurately guess how long things\nwill take and plan for them properly.

I’ll overcome peer pressure by, with the ability in this new\nenvironment of college to form new habits, form new friends who are serious\nabout college and motivated to do well will create positive peer pressure for\nme to succeed. Applying the LTL methods will make up for my lack of experience\nin learning how to learn. I’ll predict exam questions, develop good learning\nhabits, and do well in school.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I’ll\nget around the barrier of wanting to do so many extra-curricular activities and\nthus ignore academic work. I won’t lose focus of the chance to shape the rest\nof my life by being involved in the non-academic side of college life. A low\nGPA means forfeiting opportunities in gaining new skills and finding new goals\nfor the rest of my life. I can add extra-curricular activities to my college\nwork with time management strategies.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\n\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;\nmso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'><br clear=all\nstyle='mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always'>\n</span>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>3 November 2012<u style='text-underline:\nwords'><o:p></o:p></u></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Journal 2.1: How do I feel about\nchanging my note-taking system?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I\nam excited to change my note system because it will be good to have a\npre-developed system that I can learn to use for myself. However, I do feel\nhesitant about leaving a three-inch margin and the entire backside of each page\nblank. I like to be efficient with the amount of paper I use for note taking.\nHowever, I’m being continually told, “note-taking is not the time to save\npaper!” So, I’m trying to accept that and move on using a lot of paper to take\nnotes. However, part of my hesitation comes from not having taken advantage of\nall of that extra space too frequently after class. The three-inch margin I\nhave used at times for questions, and I have used the other page one time for\nvisual learning methods. This is when I learned the best though; I know that\nthese things worked well for me though because on a recent OT exam I remember\nseeing the pages of my notes that I took, wrote questions for, and used visual\nlearning methods for much more clearly than I do the notes that I didn’t do\nanything with after class. My ultimate goal now is to write questions after\nclass, write a summary, an essay question, use visual learning methods, and\nthen go back and review these periodically. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\n\"MS Mincho\";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;\nmso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'><br clear=all\nstyle='mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always'>\n</span>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>9 November 2012</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>Journal\n3.1: How does the LTL method for reading to answer questions incorporate the\nfour learning tools, and how does my current method of reading compare to\nreading to answer questions?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The\nLTL method for reading incorporates the first learning tool of asking questions\nby, after surveying the chapter, having the user go through the chapter and\nwrite questions about the chapter content based on the headings and starts of\nparagraphs. It incorporates the second learning tool by breaking the assignment\nto read into the manageable tasks of (1) glancing over the chapter, (2) writing\nquestions from headings, subheadings, pictures, and charts, (3) read for\nanswers to the questions one has written, while underlining key words and\nphrases, and (4) revising questions if needed. The LTL method for reading\nincorporates the third learning tool of setting goals by having questions for\nthe reader to keep in mind while they read. These questions act as <span\nclass=GramE>short term</span> goals; the reader’s shortest term goal is to\nanswer these questions. The larger goal of LTL is to comprehend and remember\nwhat is needed from the reading assignment. The LTL method of reading\nincorporates the 4<sup>th</sup> learning tool, getting feedback, by having the\nreader able to review their understanding of a chapter by looking over some of\nthe questions later and answering them without referencing the textbook.\nWhether or not they can answer the questions gives them feedback as to how well\nthey understand the information.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>My\nmethod of reading is much was much more passive before I adopted the LTL\nreading method.

One, that then was the\ntime to schedule for classes next semester or else I would miss what I wanted\nto take<span class=GramE>—“</span>the perfect schedule and best teachers.”\nReason two was that I had three mastering chemistry questions due at midnight.\nThree was that I needed to read “A General Introduction to Psychology” all at\nonce right now (and I thought that I would have to read about 60 pages). A\nfinal reason was that I wanted to hang out with my friends instead of being\nalone doing work. My reasons for procrastinating can easily be hidden from me,\nor very subconscious reasons. These reasons were the controlling influences\npreventing me from working on my psychology essay rough draft.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However,\nI came up with a number of arguments against these delays as well. One, I could\nhave spent much less time choosing the extra classes I didn’t need like PE’s\nand 2 credits, realizing that after I make the basic schedule future <span\nclass=GramE>time</span> I spend planning will yield little. Two, I evaluated\nhow many points the Mastering Chemistry questions were worth versus the number\nof points the rough draft was worth. It was 4 against 70 points. I could do\nthose questions as a break from writing the essay. Three, I realized that I\ndidn’t have to read an overwhelming amount of text to get some ideas for my\nessay. And four, I realized checked my priorities and values, and seeing that\nnothing dire was happening with my friends, I could forego spending time with\nthem for my higher priority of completing schoolwork on time. Also, I could\nhave gotten together with another student who was also working on the\npsychology rough draft to fulfill my desire to be with others and do my work.\nThis would probably even help me do even better because I could bounce ideas\noff them and work through them in conversation.
