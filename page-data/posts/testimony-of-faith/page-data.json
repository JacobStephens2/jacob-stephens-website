This is a declaration of why my faith is in God. He proved his love for\nme by sending His son to die for my sins, so that I may have eternal life in\nthe goodness of God’s presence. He returned to heaven so that his Holy Spirit\nmay live in and work through me to further His kingdom. My spiritual growth has\ninvolved a series of realizations, such as the importance of being a part of\nthe church, the importance of having a personal relationship with Christ, and\nfinally the necessity of assigning ultimate value to worshiping God, which\nmeans serving him and loving him with <span class=GramE>all of</span> my heart,\nmy will, and my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'>I\ndidn’t understand the importance of being a part of the church community until\nmy early high school days. One of my youth leaders taught a powerful lesson on <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>why</i> we need Jesus, not simply another\nSunday school lesson on a Bible story. This was the kind of lesson I needed to\ngrow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'>Then\nI came to Hopewell Christian Fellowship and was led into understanding the\nvalue of personal relationship and experience with God. I was taught several\nspiritual disciplines including service, meditation, worship, and study of the\nword. It was with Fusion I had my first <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'>personal\nexperiences of God, I heard him speak to me while sitting in silence <span\nclass=GramE>meditating, and</span> felt his strength and endurance work through\nme on the Reading mission trip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'>These\nbrief experiences were certainly faith boosting, but they still weren’t enough\nto change my heart’s number one desire. My faith was merely mental, and deep\ndown my heart wasn’t seeking after God. I heard all around me having grown up\nin the church that devoting my life first to God would give me the best life,\nbut it would take more than hearing about it to change me. Before I gave my\nlife to <span class=GramE>God</span> I fell many times in my own sin. I pursued\nthe fleshly desires of my unchanged heart. I chased after girls when I should\nhave been spending time in the word. Later <span class=GramE>on</span> I tried\ndrugs, my friends thought it was cool, and eventually I started seeking truth\nout in the twisted reality of psychedelics. All I found in pursuing these\nthings was empty success, damage to myself, and hurt people around me. I\nthought that the temptations of worldly things somehow would give me happiness,\nmeaning. I didn’t understand that it was only when I pursued God’s\nrighteousness first that I would be blessed with everything I sought out in the\nworld: happiness, content, mission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'>God\nworked through Christians around me to lead me to his light. A brother in\nChrist, out of love told my parents of my trying LSD, as much as it turned my\nlife upside down at that time, I can’t thank him enough now. A couple months\nlater a sister in Christ challenged me to a higher standard of not doing drugs\nfor the sake of having a better relationship with my parents because then I\nwouldn’t have to lie to them about anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> \n</span>The Lord repeatedly says throughout the Bible to honor your parents and\nyou will be blessed. He certainly has blessed me since I’ve been honest with\nthem. Living to this higher standard gave me a taste of the deep joy God gives\na person when they seek him as their number one priority. As I felt this new\nfeeling living for God was giving me, I desired to know God more. For the first\ntime I began seeking God out on my own, wondering who the author of my story\nis. I began listening to the Bible on audiotape as often as I could when at\nwork. I would go through entire books of the Bible in a day, and soon one of my\nyouth leaders showed me various pastors’ sermons. </span><span\nclass=MsoBookTitle><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif'>I\nnow have a mission greater than myself, a cause worth dying for. Having that\nsort of purpose gives me the sort of <span class=GramE>cause</span> I was\ndesigned to fight for. My faith is wholeheartedly in God, because he carried me\nout of my old life of sin by showing me the well of water from which I will\nnever grow thirsty. God is leading me into the joyous, righteous life he wants\nme to live for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n</div>\n\n","title":"Testimony of Faith","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/autobiography/","name":"Autobiography"},{"link":"/posts/category/religion/","name":"Religion"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"Hopewell Christian Fellowship’s 2011 Mission Trip to Peru","uri":"/posts/hopewell-christian-fellowships-2011-mission-trip-to-peru/"},"prevPost":{"title":"Career Choice: Computer Software Engineering","uri":"/posts/career-choice-computer-software-engineering/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":721,"nextId":553,"prevId":796}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
