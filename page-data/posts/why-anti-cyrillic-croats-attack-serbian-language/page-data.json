After the 2011 Croatian census, <span\nclass=GramE>a number of</span> cities in the Croatian county of <span\nclass=SpellE>Vukovar-Syrmia</span> realized that they would be legally bound to\nerect bilingual signs featuring both the Latin script Croatian and the Cyrillic\nscript Serbian. The two languages are nearly as similar spoken as American and\nAustralian English. In 2013, after the town of <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span>\nplaced bilingual signs at the entrance of the town hall, a mob of war vets who\nhad defended the city gathered and violently tore down the signs.

That same year,\n20,000 people gathered in the Croatian capital protesting the incorporation of\nCyrillic into public use (Pavelic). Minority language is required in public use\nin districts where over a third of the population is a minority. <span\nclass=GramE>In order to</span> request a change to this law, 10% of the voting\npopulation must sign a petition, which in turn authorizes a referendum. In\nCroatia that&#8217;s about 450,000 Croatian signatures required. In 2014, an\nanti-Cyrillic group gathered a petition of over 575,000 signatures requesting a\nchange to the Constitutional Law on National Minorities.

For the sake of simplicity, we will\nrefer to the anti-Cyrillic group as Croats, however, there are pro-Cyrillic\nCroats. Croats mythologize the invasion of <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span>, victimize\nSerbs, then get the scapegoat effect. Understanding the inter and intra group\nrelations in this situation helps us determine how to resolve the violence that\nis happening. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%;mso-outline-level:1'><b\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'>Girard&#8217;s\nmimetic theory</span></b><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Girard has a theory of mimetic desire, which explains the\nways that people develop desire. People develop desire by influencing one\nanother. In Williams&#8217; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Girard Reader</i>,\non page 9, Girard states, &quot;If acquisition and appropriation were included\n[in the literature on imitation], imitation as a social phenomenon would turn\nout to be more problematic than it appears, and above all conflictual.&quot;\nThis is a type of philosophical anthropology. Girard <span class=GramE>offers an\nexplanation for</span> how peoples&#8217; desires originate. If party A desires\nnational identity, and party A interacts with party B, party B may develop the\nsame desire for a national identity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Mimetic rivalry is the situation when multiple parties are\nfighting over the same object of desire, but they cannot both acquire or attain\nit. Girard states that &quot;Each tries to push aside the obstacle that the\nother places in his path. Violence is generated by this process; or rather\nviolence is the process itself when two or more partners try to prevent one\nanother from appropriating the object they all desire through physical or other\nmeans.&quot; As multiple individuals, such as various war veterans within the\nCroatian war veteran community, strive for the same object, such as a unique\nmilitary honor, violence is when they take efforts to stop or block the other\nfrom acquiring the military honor, so that they themselves can have it instead.\nMimetic rivalry occurs over objects that both parties cannot acquire. There is\nonly enough for one or one group.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Further, Girard goes on to <span class=GramE>offer an\nexplanation of</span> ritual using mimetic rivalry. Religions create\nprohibitions <span class=GramE>in order to</span> limit the conflicts that\ncould come up as a result of the ways people push each other out of the way. Monogamous\nmarriage is a Christian ritual. A ritual is a way that people repeatedly act, and\nimbue those acts with meaning, and may even be believed to enact change. The\nritual act may be understood as more than symbolic, but as sacramental &#8211;\neffecting substantive <span class=GramE>change in reality</span>. But how could\nmonogamous marriage be limiting in a helpful way, a prohibition that limits\nmimetic conflict? This ritual may have begun out of a community where there was\na lack of order, or a lack of differentiation. When people are undifferentiated\nand vying for the same limited objects, they end up conflicting. Not everyone\ncan have the one <span class=GramE>particular person</span> as a spouse, but\nwhen the ritual of marriage is enacted, those two become a distinct unit &#8211; <i\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>differentiated</i> from others. This\nestablishment creates a clear boundary between people as to what objects they\nmay desire, and this helps minimize people from desiring the same person as a\nspouse. When someone is married, it becomes taboo to want that person for <span\nclass=GramE>one&#8217;s self</span>. These sorts of prohibitions discourage mimetic\nrivalry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Mimetic theory explains myths, which often are told in\ntandem with rituals. Girard explains the structure of myth. The community is\ndisordered or undifferentiated. A mimetic disturbance in the community\ngenerates the myth. An individual or group is convicted of a fault and then that\nsame individual seen as the cause of the crisis. The victim is killed. Then\norder is regenerated, and the victim is revealed as divine or sacred. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Sacrifice occurs at the end of some rituals, and this plays\na key, unifying function in a group. &quot;Real or symbolic, sacrifice is\nprimarily a collective action of the entire community, which purifies itself of\nits own disorder through the unanimous immolation of a victim, but this can\nhappen only at the paroxysm of the ritual crisis.&quot; After the violence of\nmimetic rivalry, people often feel chaotic, and disparate in their sense of\ngroup identity. Once they create a rival, then they have again a sense of\nunification of purpose &#8211; to remove the threat, and order is temporarily\nrestored.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%;mso-outline-level:1'><b\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'>The\ndevelopment of Croatian desire for pure identity</span></b><span\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>As Misha Glenny observes in his account of the beginning of\nthe Balkan Wars of the 90s, the leaders of Bosnia and Macedonia recognized that\nif Croatia were to secede from Yugoslavia, they would need to become\n&quot;identified explicitly with the Croat people to the exclusion of others&quot;.\nThis is one recognition that shows that during the war, Croatia painted itself\nas a nation primarily of Croats. Given this emphasis on being a Croatian, that\nsame sentiment extended into the army, and soldiers received that\nencouragement. Now presently, as veterans continue to hold on to the identity\ngiven to them during war time, in order to maintain <span class=GramE>that,</span>\nthere needs to be substantive differentiation between them and Serbs, just as\nthere was in the war. During wartime, Serbs were the enemies. Now, a\ndifferentiation between Croats and Serbs is that Croats get to use their\nlanguage in the public space, excluding Serbian. If Serbian becomes an official\nlanguage as well, a level of distinction and differentiation is lost between\nthe Croats and Serbs. The Croats desire became, <span class=GramE>as a result\nof</span> the messages governments sent their people: I want to be a good\nCroatian, which meant hating Serbs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Many Croats in post-war Croatia have desired a pure\nidentity, especially veterans who were told they were the righteous people\ngoing in to fight the dirty Serb <span class=SpellE>Ćetniks</span>. The term <span\nclass=SpellE>Ćetnik</span> has history in World War II. During that time there\nwas a political group fighting for revolution who were called <span\nclass=SpellE>Ćetniks</span>. They were a very violent group who slaughtered\nmany Croatians. And as some people started to desire pure identity, others\nfollowed suit. The Tudjman administration portrayed a nationalistic image of\nthe good Croatian fighters who avenge wrongs done in the distant past to the\nCroatian people. In 1991 Croatia persuaded Germany &quot;that its cause was\njust by presenting itself &#8216;as an integral part of a civilized Catholic, central\nEuropean culture while denigrating its Serbian neighbor as a representative of\nthe barbaric, despotic Orient. Moreover, the drive for independence was\npresented as an act of liberation from decades of Serbian oppression.&quot; In\nthis way, the veterans were portrayed as a type of hero fighting for freedom\nand the purity of Croatia. As veterans came back, they retained this desire to\nbe a pure people, and others caught on and mimicked their desire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Why do the Croatian veterans want to guard their pure\nidentity so much? It may be one of the few pieces of their identity that gives\nthem a greater sense of meaning or purpose. They have returned to society, to a\nlife that is not quite as intense or purposeful as their life in war was. As Chris\nHedges observes, war &quot;does create a feeling of comradeship that\nobliterates<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>our alienation and makes us, for perhaps the only time in\nour life, feel that we belong. War allows us to rise above our small stations\nin life. We find nobility in a cause and feelings of selflessness, even bliss.\nAt a time of soaring deficits and financial scandals and the very deterioration\nof our domestic fabric, war is a fine diversion.&quot; If that experience of\nnobility during war becomes a memory that is marred and impure, they may be\ndevastated as a result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%;mso-outline-level:1'><b\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'>Fraying\nof unity in the Croatian veteran community</span></b><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>People clashed though as they pursued this object of desire,\nthis purity of identity, which is a desire to have one&#8217;s war identity be\nunmarred and clean, not <span class=GramE>dirty</span> or wrong. People want\nthat identity to be them having fought for good, just as the government told\nthem they were doing &#8211; fighting for justice. Unfortunately, they could not and would\nnever attain this <span class=GramE>object</span> but they did not recognize\nthat, but, in keeping hope that they can, so they pushed the others out of the\nway in their pursuit, doing violence to each other in the process. They\nbelieved that they needed this pure identity to be happy and satisfied.\nCroatian war veterans experienced a tension with this message about who they\nare while at war, where they committed war crimes and lost some of their purity.\nCroats carried out operations where Serbian civilian areas were the targets for\nbombing (Traynor). These operations have been judged as acts of ethnic\ncleansing. These memories are suppressed and hidden, however, and never brought\nup by the anti-Cyrillic Croats, so that they can maintain the illusion that\nthey were capable of being and becoming the pure people they were told they\nwere. Croats began to get anxious as they go longer without acquiring their\nobject of desire, and they end up hurting other members of the same-desiring community\nperceived as obstacles to getting what they need. PTSD in Croatia is shown as a\nprevalent phenomenon, especially as causing poorer quality of life for family\nmembers of veterans with PTSD (Peraica et. al.). In these families there is\nshown to be damage to psychological health and social relations. A women&#8217;s\nrights organization called Be active, <span class=GramE>Be</span> emancipated (<span\nclass=SpellE>B.a.B.e</span>.), has programs dedicated to counseling for healing\nfrom domestic abuses, and legal advice and assistance for follow up on abuses.\nWe see that violence has festered within the Croat community itself, and I\nsuggest in the entire pure-identity desiring community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Why would war veteran Croats keep each other from reaching\ntheir goal of pure identity? As vets remembered their war deeds, others cringed\nbecause of the dirtiness of them, which revealed to them the dirtiness, if they\nabuse others in response to their disgusted reactions, perhaps that will quiet\nthem, and then they can stop having their pure war hero image marred by others.\nOthers kept war vets from having a pure identity. If they bring this part of\ntheir identity out and discuss it others will be disgusted. Also, others may\nbring up and critique the actions that the Croats took during the war. The\ncriminality of concentration camps is one thing that may be brought up, which\nresults in vets being reminded of the bad things they did. They cannot fool\nthemselves into being pure and blameless when they are having their war crimes\nbrought to their attention. Then these reactions and messages get in the way of\nthe veterans attaining what they believe will satisfy them. So perhaps abuse\nwould silence those who are bringing up these messages. The Croat war vet\ncommunity not only builds tensions <span class=GramE>as a result of</span>\nattaining their goal continually being thwarted, but it also begins to be disordered\nand chaotic. Abuses in families and lack of social relationships give less of a\nsense of cohesion to the community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%;mso-outline-level:1'><b\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'>Veterans\nunify against Serbs</span></b><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Croats need a solution for the tensions building up in their\ncommunity. They must find some way to bring themselves back together while they\ncontinue pursuing their object of desire. <span class=GramE>In order to</span>\ndraw the community together without doing too much damage to another member, or\nwithout having to admit their own fault in the problem, they find a party who\ncan take the blame for the ills and problems the community is facing. In the\ncase of the Croat, they blame the Serb. The Serb becomes the party to be\nsacrificed. Croats are willing to sever relationship with the Serb and paint them\nas dirty and unapologetic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Croats start to form a mythology. In this case it&#8217;s the\nstory of Serbian invasion of <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span>. Note that Serbs\ndid do real violence against Croats, but this is part of what makes them the\nperfect candidate for sacrifice. They have done something wrong, which seems\nsomewhat related to the problems of the original community, but perhaps they\nreally aren&#8217;t the cause of the Croat&#8217;s problems. The mythology explains how\nSerbs are dirty, godless, unapologetic, did great evil against us Croatians,\nand now need to be expelled, diminished, or pushed back against, because they\nare the cause of our problems. The exclusion takes the surface form of keeping\nSerbian language out of public life, which is justified by Croats by appealing to\nthe story of <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span>. Note that their story is that\nthey don&#8217;t recognize any weight to the Serbian president having apologized for\nSerbia&#8217;s actions against <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span>, and they don&#8217;t\nrealize their own impure acts against the Serbs in the war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>We see this blaming in action when Croats lament the\nmemories that Cyrillic brings them. The leader of the anti-Cyrillic movement&#8217;s\nname is Tomislav <span class=SpellE>Josic</span>. In response to the sign\ntearing down he told the media that <span style='color:#2D3033'>&quot;Cyrillic\nletters used to come to <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span> on army tanks,&#8217; &#8230;\nreferring to the occupation of the town by Serb rebels during the 1991-1995 war&quot;\n(<span class=SpellE>Kartus</span>). Here we see the attitude of the protestors\nagainst Cyrillic as something they say reminds them of the invasion.</span> This\nanti-Cyrillic sentiment binds together the people against it, as they remember\nthe invasion against them as a clearly defined group of people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Furthermore, we see this victimization claim in the HDZ&#8217;s\nstatements requesting that <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span> be a place\nexempted from the minority language law. &quot;The HDZ does not agree with the\nsetting of the Cyrillic alphabet.&nbsp;We ask that the city of <span\nclass=SpellE>Vukovar</span> is a special piety, we ask that the Government has\nthe sensibility and emotion for what is happening in <span class=SpellE>Vukovar</span>&quot;\n(Dalmacija).<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Croats then get the scapegoat effect, which binds them\ntogether. The scapegoat effect is &quot;that strange process through which two\nor more people are reconciled at the expense of a third party who appears\nguilty or responsible for whatever ails, disturbs, or frightens the\nscapegoaters. They feel relieved of their <span class=GramE>tensions</span> and\nthey coalesce into a more harmonious group. They now have a single purpose,\nwhich is to prevent the scapegoat from harming them, by expelling and\ndestroying them.&quot; Preventing the Serbs from putting up Cyrillic language\ngives the nationalistic Croats a sense of unity and order, which they\nappreciate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>In attacking the Cyrillic part of the bilingual town hall sign,\nthe Croats were able to act in a unified way against a clearly defined\nantagonist. <span class=SpellE>Josic</span> stated that <span style='color:\n#2D3033'>“Our friends from all over Croatia would come and help us tear down\nthe signs.” </span>The Cyrillic represented the Serbs, who Croats could blame\nfor their own ills. The Croats bring up the Serbs and their invasion as the\ncause of their own ills. Which was a true event &#8211; the Serbs really did attack\nand invade. But the true cause of being pulled apart is the Croat war vets&#8217; own\ninability to attain their object of desire &#8211; pure identity. And as time goes\non, this group no longer feels so unified as they once did. Their identity\nmarkers are becoming less clearly distinguished from Serbs. If Serbs get the\nright to official language use, then that&#8217;s one more act of undifferentiating\nput into place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>Though attacking the language of Cyrillic may bring the\ncommunity of veterans back together, and in that way give them the scapegoat\neffect, one way that this anti-Serbian situation does not fit with Girard&#8217;s\ntheory is that the Serbs are not revealed as sacred after their being\n&quot;killed&quot;. When I say that the Serbs are killed, I am pointing to the\nviolence the Croats have done in limiting the Serbs. It is not so extreme as to\nhave killed anyone, though there is tension. Perhaps because no one has been\nkilled this is part of the reason why no Serb is praised as divine, <span\nclass=GramE>noble</span> or helpful. Normally the victim that is limited or\nwhich has had relationship cut off from the rest of the group is then seen as\nbringing peace, or somehow appeasing some divine anger. However, if the Serbs\nwould agree to take this position as victims, as the cause of the problem in\nCroatian vets and apologize for it, then they would be venerated. They would\nstill be limited, but also appreciated as willing to admit their own complicity\nin the problem.

Furthermore, an understanding of the cause of\nantagonism against Serbs proves helpful: Croats are trying to get a pure\nidentity, but can&#8217;t, and in the process are denying hurtful parts of their\nexperience contradict their acquisition of pure identity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\"'>As Croats continue with war trauma, which keep them from\nreaching, and causing them to do violence to each other, and then spilling over\ninto other groups.

Long term healing\nwill require the Croat community to develop desire a different object, and in\nthis case, that means a willingness to give up the hope of this a pure identity\nwhich consists of Croatians as not guilty in the war. The message that people\nmust be willing to accept that they have a dirty past. It was difficult for a\nfew Israeli soldiers to admit their crimes in 1948 (Cook).
