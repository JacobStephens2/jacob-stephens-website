That question proves\nhelpful in our deliberating about what political actions we ought to take. With\nthis essay I aim to respond to Nussbaum&#8217;s ideas about adaptive preference. I\nhave two main points I want to get across. The first: adaptive preference can\nlead to despair if taken to an extreme, yet it can lead to grace if balanced\nwith agency. My second point: adaptive preference and René Girard&#8217;s mimetic\ndesire illuminate each other. My essay will be structured in the following way.\n<span class=\"GramE\">First</span> I will explain the two ideas Nussbaum presents\nthat I will wrestle with. Then I will critique those ideas, offering my points\nin response. Then I will discuss societal implications of these ideas, then\npersonal implications, and finally I will conclude the essay.</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adaptive preference reveals the way people have been\nsocialized into some preferences as opposed to having chosen them. An example\nof this is the situation where someone wants to enter into a gendered,\nnormative, submissive relationship with their spouse, we recognize that\npreference may have been a development of that person&#8217;s culture and\nenvironment, and as a result, that preference may not really be what is best\nfor them, and instead this seems to be a preference that the woman and man\ndeveloped as a result of living in their particular settings. Little choice\nexists in my preference when that is the only preference my environment\nprovided me with.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here is the\nsecond idea: Adaptive preference states that the development of preference for particular\nthings is affected by limited options. This is a very similar concept to what\nwe just presented. We can again take up the example of the woman growing up in\na conservative Christian town. Here we will point out that in her upbringing there\nwere no other options presented to her. <span class=\"GramE\">So</span> she chose\nwhat she did because it was her only option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering\nadaptive preference in a more extreme situation will reveal more to us. We will\nsee that the lack of options can cultivate toleration for what should be\nintolerable. Consider a wife in India with no freedom to associate or affiliate\nwith others in such a way which could develop friendships. This restriction may\nbe imposed on her by her husband. This is the lot of many women in India.\nNussbaum provided this example. Here, the woman we are examining may come to think\nthat this little choice or freedom that she has is simply woman&#8217;s way of life.\nMany women do come to accept these damaging situations as women&#8217;s lot. If we remember\nthe capabilities approach, we will have a set of propositions which we can use\nto say that this should not be the lot of any being we want to call human. If\nshe&#8217;s human, she ought to be able to develop affiliations with other people.</p>\n\n<h2>Critique</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">An extreme affirmation of adaptive preference can lead to\ndespair. If someone affirms that all of their preferences have come out of the\nsituations they have been in, then they can think &#8220;Wow, I am no more than pre-determined&#8221;\nand then they can lose the will to participate in their life. They can lose the\nwill to take an active part in the life they are living and the person they are\nbecoming. I am assuming that taking an active part in one&#8217;s life is good. This\nidea about participating in one&#8217;s own development comes from James Taylor. When\nconsigning themselves to an extreme understanding of adaptive preference, that\nbelief will have a toxic <span class=\"SpellE\">affect</span> on the person because\nit will keep them from participating in their own development.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, if\na balance is found, where one recognizes the ways that their preferences have\nbeen shaped, yet they also realize that they did have some choice in their\ndevelopment and in their future, then they can have not only hope, but also grace.\nRecognizing that someone else&#8217;s preference may come out of a situation which\nwas very limited may help birth in us compassion towards them. I want to go further\nand say it will give us compassion. The woman who has not known clean water can\nhardly be blamed for her satisfaction with dirty water, but when she learns of\nand experiences cleanliness, she will begin to want that. This is another example\nfrom Nussbaum&#8217;s book which in imaging, perhaps we can start to feel some of the\ncompassion and grace towards those women for their seemingly low standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Girard&#8217;s concept\nof mimesis gives a similar account to the development of desire as adaptive\npreference. Mimesis understands the development of desire to come from exposure\nto others&#8217; desires. Mimesis is a process that is like osmosis from others.\nIndividuals need others in order to develop their preferences. Adaptive preference\ndoes not require individuals to have exposure to another&#8217;s particular desire in\norder for them to develop a preference. Adaptive preference springs up when\nthere is a situation where someone has had only particular exposures, and <span class=\"GramE\">also</span> they have had only limited options. They have only been\nintroduced to so much and they have only encountered a limited range of ideas,\nrelationships, and freedoms.</p>\n\n<h2>Societal Implications</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let&#8217;s consider the Trump phenomenon using the concept of\nadaptive preference, which results in people &#8216;s preferences not being the\nresult of free choices, but instead the result of environmental effect. Trump\nhas become peoples&#8217; choice because that is the way their environment has shaped\nthem. When peoples&#8217; environment is all pointing to Trump, they are likely going\nto turn towards him. Dr. George suggested the following: consider a person\nwithout a strong identity and who has a difficult, disappointed life, then they\nstart to hear this call from Trump to a strong sense of national identity. This\nwill excite the person and stir them to be roused and interested in what is\nbeing presented to them. Then as an effect, they start to support Trump because\nof the nationalistic messages that came into their environment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not\nto say that there is nothing that these people can do but support Trump. Earlier\nwe discussed the necessity of maintaining an element of freedom in our\nconception of adaptive preference. A deterministic adaptive preference leads to\ndespair. A person could still reject the candidate placed before them. However,\nthis might lead to some sort of death for them. That death might be social. This\nis what makes a situation where people will be rejected for a particular belief\nso potentially costly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,\nin some situations Trump seems to be some groups only option. If people are fed\nup with politics and they want a strong national identity, then he is the only\noption. A person finds out that the presidential primary is coming, and then\nthey think about what they think of politics. They realize that they dislike politics,\nbecause they think that politicians are always evil and self-motivated. <span class=\"GramE\">So</span> they learn that there is a candidate without experience\nas a professional politician. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>Then he\nbecomes their preference. This is helpful for them because then they can go\nwith that one thing that they want. They may have no options other than this\nperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A person\nmay feel pushed or cornered into this support of Trump because they don&#8217;t know\nanyone else in their community who is in support of another candidate. And\ntheir closest relationships may be all with people who are supporting Trump. Fear\nof changing their belief may exist in that person. They may anticipate\nconjuring wrath or rejection from those with whom they are in close\nrelationship. This anticipated rejection often keeps people from switching\npositions.</p>\n\n<h2>Personal Implications</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A person may come to stand against marriage where the roles\nare gendered. The reason for this may be because the message that they have\nreceived all their life about how relationships ought to be. Imagine her living\nin that environment. First, she lives in a town that is mostly conservative Christian,\nthen she goes to a private school, and then stays in that town working in the\nChristian bookstore. At no point must she live with others in such a way that\nchallenges her position against gendered roles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An\nimportant thing to recognize while discussing adaptive preference is that this\nconcept also applies to me. I am a person who has aspired to develop good\nwriting skills, or to develop a good juvenile justice system. These are preferences\nwhich I have developed based on my environments. I have come to want to restore\nthe juvenile justice system as a result of being at Gordon. Being at Gordon I\nhave seen people care about this. Now we are back to mimetic desire. We must realize\nthe importance of having other people around to demonstrate the desires we want\nto cultivate in people. We can also remember the SEWA people that the\norganization in India ministered to. They showed videos of women similar to the\nwomen who were presented to the video doing things like going out and\naffiliating with new people, and that helped them to long for and desire that\nnew condition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If I have\n&#8220;chosen Christianity&#8221; and I&#8217;m going to use the language of choice, I\nmust ask if I really had any other options. It seems difficult and unrealistic\nto expect me to enter another meaning framework or faith commitment in my years\nup through 9th grade because my only affiliations were with people who were\nChristians. My only adult relationships that I had were in relationship with\nChristian older people. My only peers and Christians family all identified as\nChristian. I would be the one odd person out if I rejected Christianity. &#8220;Sure&#8221;\nI said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take up my cross daily&#8221; and at least take on the\nChristian identity marker and make effort to do it if that&#8217;s the only thing\nI&#8217;ve been exposed to. To choose anything else would have meant being put out\nfrom the community. And that would have been death for me. But then when I\nstarted to develop other friends and relationships outside of that <span class=\"GramE\">community</span> I began to come closer to having a real option.\nThough, I still did not have any close adult relationships who could have\nserved as mentors for me to step into this other faith commitment, even if that\nwere atheism. Or if it were a more mystical sense of reality and God. If I had\nhad a wider circle of affiliation, my choice of Christianity would have been\nmore meaningful. This is not to deny the good that it created in my life, but\nto recognize that some of the reason I &#8220;chose&#8221; Christianity was\nbecause it was the only real option I had. </p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In summary, people experience adaptive freedom, and the awareness\nof it can either bringing them into despair or pull them to greater compassion towards\nothers. If they take it too far and altogether reject choice and they will lose\nhope, but if they keep the concept of choice and believe that this does affect\npeople though, then they will be illuminated to have more grace for people.\nFurthermore, the concept of adaptive preference is similar to mimetic desire. Both\ndescribe the development of desire in people; however, they differ in their\naccount of whether others are necessary for the development of those desires.\nMimetic desire attributes desires&#8217; origin more to others, while adaptive\npreference attributes desires&#8217; origins to circumstances that are limited in the\noptions, they realistically offer their participants or the people living in\nthose circumstances. I hope that we can take this knowledge and be inspired to\ngreater grace and understanding with it.</p>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\nCalibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\"><br clear=\"all\" style=\"mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always\">\n</span>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<h1>Bibliography</h1>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">George, Ivy.
