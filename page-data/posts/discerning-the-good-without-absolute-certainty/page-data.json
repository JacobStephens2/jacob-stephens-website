Here we have two people\nliving together in <span class=SpellE>Slovonia</span>, and they hold to\ndifferent positions about what makes for the highest good of the region. Their\nviews conflict. And their political actions push against each other. With\nstrong enough conviction and a willingness to use violence, <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span>\ncould push to violate the <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span> and his people. This\nconflict about what is best for a region happens everywhere people live\ntogether. How can <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> develop a value for <span\nclass=SpellE>Sloba&#8217;s</span> perspective so great that <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span>\nbegins to seek out <span class=SpellE>Sloba&#8217;s</span> perspective? I propose one\nway is through philosophy. Given that <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> has a\nfew qualifying characteristics, such as a desire for truth, justice, and a\ndesire for some sort of life together with <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span>, and\neven a love for <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span>, if <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span>\naccepts a particular philosophical understanding, he will begin to seek to\nunderstand the way that <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span> sees the educational\nsituation. With this philosophical understanding, as <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span>\nlooks to develop his response such that it will realize the highest good, he\nwill recognize that finding out what <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span> thinks\nwill prove very helpful. As <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> understands <span\nclass=SpellE>Sloba&#8217;s</span> perspective more and more, he, if willing to\nchange, will modify, replace, or strengthen the convictions about education in <span\nclass=SpellE>Slovonia</span> he held prior to seeing from <span class=SpellE>Sloba&#8217;s</span>\nstandpoint. Furthermore, I take it as a given that objective good exists, and\nthat people can discern with reasonable certainty which of their decisions will\nbring out the <span class=GramE>most good</span>.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The philosophical <span\nclass=GramE>understanding</span> I pose is as follows: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>because of our finite, biased, and interpretive nature, we cannot\nachieve complete certainty that our judgments are true or that our responses\nare good.</i> Accepting this will lead <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> to\nseek out <span class=SpellE>Sloba&#8217;s</span> perspective. However, without the\ntandem understanding that we can have ideas and plans that are closer to the\nobjective good, <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> will become despairing, and\nlose motivation to seek truth. Although we cannot achieve complete certainty,\nwe can achieve enough to form convictions and act. I will start by explaining <span\nclass=SpellE>Ricoeur&#8217;s</span> understanding of our finitude, especially\nfocusing on human capacity and the groundless ground source of life. I will\ndevelop Kearney&#8217;s conception of the alterity of others, Finally, with Volf I\nwill develop the idea of the limit of our social location on our ability to\nobjectively access truth, and I will relate each major idea back to <span\nclass=SpellE>Čedomir&#8217;s</span> situation, and the way each idea will call him to\nrealize something about his own understanding, and then the way that will lead\nhim a step closer to seeking out <span class=SpellE>Sloba&#8217;s</span> perspective.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I propose to introduce the certainty\nproblematic which stems from our finitude as did <span class=SpellE>Ricoeur</span>\nin &quot;Religious Belief: The Difficult Path of the Religious&quot;.

Whenever we make a judgment, or an\ninterpretation about someone, there might be something about them that we have\nnot yet seen that contradicts our interpretation or categorization. We cannot\nknow, by the nature of their self that is not knowable in entirety. This aspect\nof others as not knowable in full, means that even in part, when we do make a\njudgment about them, that aspect could be wrong. To go even further, harkening\nback to <span class=SpellE>Ricoeur</span>, people are connected to the infinite\nsource of life, which gives them even greater capacity for changing away from\nwhat we determined they were initially.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This has implications for realizing our\npotential error as we move formulate responses to realize the highest good for\na group of people. <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span>, as he makes decisions\nabout what is going to benefit the people of Eastern <span class=SpellE>Slovonia</span>\nmost, realizes that his judgments might be off, because his interpretations of\nthe alterity bearing others may be too based on his understanding of himself.\nPerhaps <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> sees the increase in interethnic\nrelations as beneficial to <span class=GramE>himself, because</span> it will\nallow him more economic opportunities for his business &#8211; more potential\ncustomers, and say he assumes this would benefit the Serbs as well, that the\nSerbs would get more business opportunities, which would benefit them. But due\nto their alterity and otherness, they may not be as <span class=GramE>similar\nto</span> him as he has originally posited. Growing economic opportunities may\nnot benefit the Serbs most. The detriment to them caused by the removal of\ntheir right to educate in Cyrillic may outweigh the good of their expanded\neconomic opportunities. <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> is more likely to\nimagine this, or to seek out to hear directly from <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span>\nif he realizes this &#8211; that he has no way of knowing with 100% certainty what is\nbest for <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span>, or Serbs as <span class=SpellE><span\nclass=GramE>an other</span></span> to him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Miroslav\nVolf, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Exclusion and Embrace</i>,\ninsists in his chapter, &quot;Oppression and Justice&quot;, that our\nunderstandings are &quot;inescapably particular&quot;<a style='mso-endnote-id:\nedn10' href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\" title=\"\"><span\nclass=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;\nfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:\nminor-latin;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:\nEN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[x]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>,\nand as such, I posit, limited to uncertainty, yet they can retain the quality\nof likelihood, of probably being true, of being true enough to with good reason\nchoose one course of action over another.

Here is the order of ideas as they run through the chapter:\nVarying conceptions of justice clash against one another. How do we deal with\nthe problem of conflicting justices? Volf paints the universal conception of\njustice &#8211; that one justice is right above all, and that notion of justice is\naccessible to us. Volf problematizes this idea by pointing out the\nparticularity of each Christian&#8217;s understanding of justice, as well as the\nconflicts that emerge between Christians about what is just. The conclusion of\nthis recognition of our limited human notion of what we think God&#8217;s justice is\nleads us to take a provisional stance on our execution of justice<a\nstyle='mso-endnote-id:edn11' href=\"#_edn11\" name=\"_ednref11\" title=\"\"><span\nclass=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span\nclass=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;\nfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:\nminor-latin;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:\nEN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[xi]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>,\nuntil we learn more in the future, recognizing that there is always more that\nwe can learn in the future.

It is other features\nof who we <span class=SpellE>our</span>, who God is, and who others are &#8211; our\nfinitude and particularity, God&#8217;s groundless ground, others&#8217; alterity, all that\nlead us to an inability to know absolutely. If <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span>\nrealizes his particular standpoint as a Croat, and the ways that that alters\nand biases his conviction on what is best for <span class=SpellE>Slovonia</span>,\nperhaps realizing that out of his desire for his family to be able to expand\ntheir business, and therefore he wants more interethnic relations, we will\nlearn that some of his interest in this change is not out of real care and\nconcern for the other, but out of concern for himself. He will have to practice\ndouble vision, and even intertwine somewhat his life with <span class=SpellE>Sloba</span>\nand other Serbs <span class=GramE>in order to</span> gain the ability to make a\njudgment with more certainty as to its closeness what is objectively best for a\ngroup of people.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In sum, there are <span class=GramE>particular\nfeatures</span> which limit our understanding. First, as selves, we are finite,\nand cannot receive all that the source of life offers us. Secondly, when we\nformulate a response that <span class=GramE>takes into account</span> what is\nbest for others, their alterity prevents us from knowing for sure that what we\nhave chosen is really best for them, because there may be constituent to them a\npart that we do not see or know, and therefore our decision would be better if\nit had taken into account that aspect. Thirdly, as we live <span class=GramE>in\nparticular situations</span>, and have specific interests and relationships, we\nbecome biased, and our judgments about what is most just are influenced by this\nparticular history of experiences. We do not have a complete sum of\nexperiences, and as such can only see so much. Our viewpoints are limited, and\nour <span class=GramE>histories particular, which</span> limit our certainty as\nwell. If <span class=SpellE>Čedomir</span> can realize all this, and yet\nmaintain conviction that he can discern ideas that are <span class=GramE>more\nor less true</span>, he can retain motivation on his quest to honestly gauge\nwhether the right to Cyrillic education is best for <span class=SpellE>Slovonia</span>\nor not. It will be a humbling experience, and even realizing these facets of\nself and relation to other are humbling. He will need to interact with <span\nclass=SpellE>Sloba</span> or <span class=SpellE>Sloba&#8217;s</span> people to better\nunderstand what is good for them. Ultimately, realizing that we cannot know\nwith complete certainty will lead us to seek out <span class=SpellE>each\nothers&#8217;</span> perspectives, and it will give us willingness to make\nprovisional conclusions and responses, leaving us openness to receive new\ninsights as time goes on, and seek to learn from one another.</p>\n\n<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;mso-fareast-font-family:\nCalibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;\nmso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'><br\nclear=all style='mso-special-character:line-break;page-break-before:always'>\n</span>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>Works Cited<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='color:black;mso-themecolor:text1'>Kearney, Richard. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal'>Strangers, Gods, and Monsters: Interpreting otherness</i>.
