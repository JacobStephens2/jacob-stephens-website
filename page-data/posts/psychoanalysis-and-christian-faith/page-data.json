I have since learned that there are ways in which Freud\ncan be reconciled with Christian faith. Various parts of Freud will be\nconsidered in this essay: that which Christians need to deny, and the insights\nFreud had that might help us on our spiritual journey. Freud’s theory which\nstates that humans are entirely motivated by sexual desires needs to be denied,\nhowever, part that thinking can be reconciled with Christian faith. It is that\nChristians long for a deep, deep connection to another human, and that part of\nthe equation to develop that deep of a connection with another is sex. Another\ninsight Freud had that might help us on our spiritual journeys is that humans\nare essentially evil and often can’t know things by reason. This essay will\nprogress through the stages of first explaining why Christians should reject\nFreud’s theory of people being primarily motivated by sex, then it will explain\nwhy people can seem so sexually driven. Finally, it will explain an insight of\nFreud’s about human that Christians can learn from, which is that human\nreasoning is flawed by often being motivated by emotion.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Freud\nbelieved that people are essentially motivated by sexual desires:</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%'><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“The next assertion which\npsychoanalysis proclaims as one of its discoveries, affirms that those\ninstinctive impulses which one can only call sexual in the narrower as well as\nin the wider sense, play an uncommonly large role in the causation of nervous\nand mental diseases, and that those impulses are a causation which has never\nbeen adequately appreciated. Nay, indeed, psychoanalysis claims that these same\nsexual impulses have made contributions whose value cannot be overestimated to\nthe highest cultural, artistic and social achievements of the human mind.”\n(Freud 1920)</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Freud claims that sexual impulses\n(specifically sexual to generally pleasurable impulses) play a large role in\nthe causation of mental diseases, and that these impulses have not before been\nattributed as the reason for mental diseases. He also claims human sexuality to\nhave driven some very successful contributions to humanity. He made conclusions\nabout humans’ unconscious sexual drives based on case studies. According to\nMyers and Jeeves, people do have the need for very intimate connections with\nothers, “Sexual play is a recreational activity and much more. The mutual\nself-exposure and cleaving of sexual activity arise from and satisfy our need\nfor intimate communion with a loved one.” This need could also have been part\nof why Freud thought sexual drives were central to humans. This drive for\nsexuality reflects a need for intimate connection with others that was created\nby God</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Though\nthis need for deep sexual connection to another is important, neo-Freudians\nhave doubted that sexual desires are the sole desire of people “they\n[neo-Freudians] doubted that sex and aggression were all &#8211; consuming\nmotivations. Instead, they tended to emphasize loftier motives and social\ninteractions.” (Myers)</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One\nthing Freud observed that we should take note of, because it is helpful to our\nspiritual journey, is that people are essentially erroneous, and that their\nreasoning is often alternately motivated by emotions: “it is a predisposition\nof human nature to consider an unpleasant idea untrue, and then it is easy to\nfind arguments against it. Society thus brands what is unpleasant as untrue,\ndenying the conclusions of psychoanalysis with logical and pertinent arguments.\nThese arguments originate from affective sources, however, and society holds to\nthese prejudices against all attempts at refutation.” (Freud 1920). Realizing\nthe error of humanity is good because it helps us to realize we cannot be\nliberated by perfect reason. Myers and Jeeves comment on the error of human\nthinking as well: “like Pascal, we also have been bemused and even startled by\nour capacity for error, illusion, and self-deceit. Because, as the psalmist\nrecognized, “no one can see his own errors,” psychologists have devoted much\nenergy of late to revealing our most common errors.” To realize our essentially\nerroneous nature is to realize our need for perfect God.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:\nnormal'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span></b>Freud had\ncontroversial views on sexuality. The idea that people are only motivated by\nsexual desires should be rejected by Christians, but at the same time they\nshould realize the importance of sexual desires and not try to hide them.\nPeople are motivated by other things as well, and have been created to long for\ndeep, intimate, sexual connection with another person. An insight that\nChristians can gleam from Freud is that human reason is essentially flawed by\nemotion. The bible also talks about the wickedness of man’s heart. To realize\nthis biblical/Freudian idea is to recognize our need for perfect God—that a\nperfect society is impossible for us to create.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><b\nstyle='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>References<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoListParagraph style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-family:\n\"Times New Roman\",serif'>Freud, S.
