While I was in <span\nclass=GramE>Croatia</span> I learned more about community from the people I\nspent time with. I spent time with people in places where there was war torn\nexperience and where there was personal excellence. The center proved a helpful\ngrounding place to learn about community.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I will go\nthrough three parts of the way that my worldview on community has changed.\nFirst a value, then belief, and an assumption. In each section I will start by\nexplaining what the change is, then I will move into explaining how that change\nwas facilitated by my experience, and finally why that part of my experience\nimpacted me. Let us begin.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>My value of\ncommunities maintaining communication has increased. Communities need to\ncontinue to communicate within themselves and between each other. Relationship\ndies when communication stops. Suspicion starts to grow. Now I have a greater\nvalue or priority for making sure that communities consist of communication.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In Croatian\nI lived, studied and worked with the European center for the study of war and\npeace. Here I learned about the ideas of communication as necessary to\nmaintaining relationships. Here I had teachers and role models who exemplified\nthe way of life that included continuing to share ideas and experience between\npeople. And the people I lived with were also looking to learn more about this\nidea. They hoped to experience and do the same thing.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Making sure\nthat communication continues in communities is a good way to gauge their\nhealth, and because of this good aspect of the community culture I experienced,\nI affirmed the suggested differences that the Center promoted. A community may\nbe growing seeds of conflict or violence when it starts to get silent. Being\npassive aggressive is a way that can hurt people. I was passive aggressive with\nthe refrigerator at one point, rather with the dish washer. I decided not to\nput other peoples&#8217; dishes in the dish washer, and I started to get upset with\nothers about their lack of putting their dishes in the dish washer. Instead of\nsaying anything about it, I just got angry at the others. Had I communicated\nthis desire (which I eventually did), I would have solved the problem more\neasily.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I developed\nthe belief that community cannot be strong without a willingness to expose\ndifference that exists within the community. Throughout the semester I spent\ntime with a friend in the program in the same apartment as him, as an\napartment-mate, and we differed politically on some social issues, and I wanted\nto talk with him about this, but did not. I did not out of fear that he would no\nlonger speak so clearly and freely as he did. A strong community has its\nmembers knowing that they can speak about their differences without fear\narising.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>My\nreligion, identity, and conflict class proved a strong aspect of my experience\nwhich contributed to my development of this belief. Dr. Gedney taught about\ncommunication and religion in the public sphere. In order to have a maximum\namount of people talking in the public sphere from the governed polity, the\npeople are going to have to be willing to offend one another in what they say.\nAnd they will need to be able to expect grace from those who hear them. And\nforgiveness, that way they can have some of the confidence to keep speaking what\nthey believe is best for the constituency, even when it runs counter, even\noffending other parts of the polity.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I found the\nidea of a community which speaks in spite of disagreements anticipated alluring\nbecause of the promise it has for creating world peace. I try opposing this\nproposition that people speak their mind even in light of knowing they&#8217;ll hurt\nanother&#8217;s sensibilities by saying that disagreement will tear a community\napart. Given that a community may benefit from agreeing as well, and that so\nlong as agreement exists as well and the community can know that at the <span\nclass=GramE>moment</span> they can act together on what they agree upon then\nthey can move on past the disagreements, and even encounter them face to face.\nBecause the proposition has the ability to deal with this critique the belief\ngets through to me and morphs my understanding of community.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>My\nassumption that a community which regularly brings up disagreement hurts itself\nhas changed. Growing up I lived in an environment where any disagreement <span\nclass=GramE>lead</span> to the severance of relationship. And distance would\narise between disagreeing parties in the fallout of arguments. <span\nclass=GramE>So</span> I learned to understand disagreement as something which\ntears community apart. However, in the Balkans I experienced settings where\ndisagreement existed and yet the parties continued to communicate and live well\ntogether, even in light of the tensions that the disparities may have created.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In\nSrebrenica I met a curator who governs with others who have a history being\npart of the genocide 20 years ago and yet deny that it was a genocide. This\nmuseum curator is involved in town government, and Serbs who were part of the\ngenocide years ago have moved back into town. During the genocide he was young,\nso he was spared and sent away with his mother. However, his father was killed\nbecause he was a <span class=SpellE>Bosniak</span> Muslim civilian understood\nas a threat to the Serbian destiny. He spoke calmly and patiently about the\nsituation, yet he seemed to have an underlying disturbance within him. He\nrelied on God to keep enduring. He simply kept going. He shows me that\ncommunity even that disagrees on something so strongly can even continue to\nmeet face to face and live together.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I had\ndevelopment in multiple parts of the part of my worldview concerning community.\nI came to have a greater value for community which maintains communication, and\ntherefore relationship within itself and with other communities. My assumption\nthat disagreement hurts community was uprooted and replaced with the belief\nthat a community that can make disagreement regular and continue to maintain\ncommunication is a thriving community. And all these qualities I find\nsignificant because they are factors necessary to become mastered by societies\nin order to move towards peace and away from violence and war.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n","title":"Changes in me from a semester in the Balkans","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/autobiography/","name":"Autobiography"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"Why anti-Cyrillic Croats attack Serbian Language","uri":"/posts/why-anti-cyrillic-croats-attack-serbian-language/"},"prevPost":{"title":"On Adaptive Preference","uri":"/posts/on-adaptive-preference/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":489,"nextId":790,"prevId":787}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
