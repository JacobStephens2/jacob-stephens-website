In doing\nvolunteer work one’s character improves. However, work also has non-subjective\nvalue, aka, value that is unrelated to how it affects the individual doing the\nwork. If a volunteer understands the value intrinsic to the work that they are\ndoing, then they will do higher quality work. Work performed by volunteers at\nthe Lynn Boys &amp; Girls Club has intrinsic dignity, even apart from how it\naffects those doing the work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:\n12.0pt;line-height:200%;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;mso-themecolor:text1\">God Himself worked. He did\nso by creating the universe. Moses described this creation as work; “God rested\nfrom all the work that he had done in creation” (NRSV Genesis 2:3b). God\ncommissioned man to work before the fall. After blessing humankind, “God said\nto them,’…fill the earth and subdue it” (NRSV Genesis 1:27-28a). <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>According to Genesis 2:15, God willed for man\nto work, “The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till\nit and keep it.” God had a task for Adam. God brought creatures to him so that\nhe would name them, “out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal…and\nevery bird<span class=\"GramE\">…, and</span> brought them to the man to see what\nhe would call them” (NRSV Genesis 2:19). This is a task that God gave Adam to\ndo, but this was searching for a helper to be his partner more primarily than\nit was work. This searching to discover something is like research. But\nresearch is not searching for a helper, rather searching for new understanding.\nThis also could be like dating, many being brought before a man for him to find\na helper. How does this give volunteer work value? God made clothing. Genesis\n4:7 states, “If you do well, will you not be accepted?” Similarly, if we do\ngood work, then our work will yield. After Cain killed Abel, God said that Cain\nwas cursed from the ground, and that when he tilled the ground, it would no\nlonger yield to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:\n12.0pt;line-height:200%;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;mso-themecolor:text1\">How does the creation story\ndescribed in Genesis 1-3 give meaning to work? God did work. Why does God doing\nwork give it value? The way a man spends his time is a reflection of what he\nvalues (Gusdorf 223). Thus, the way God spends His time reflects what He\nvalues. There must be something about creating humans that He values. What\nabout creating humans does God value? God loves. After creating humans, He can\nexercise that part of His character to an even greater degree than He could\nprior by having a loving relationship with us. Work existed before the fall. Why\ndoes work existing before the fall give it value? In the perfect world of Eden,\nthere was work, thus, work is not a byproduct of being in a broken world. In a\nbroken world we must ask what activities we were not intended to do, however,\nfrom the Christian creation account we learn that work is an activity which we\nwere intended to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:\n12.0pt;line-height:200%;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;mso-themecolor:text1\">How did the fall affect\nwork? Because Adam disobeyed God, work no longer always yields. Also, humankind\nwas separated from face-to-face communion with God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">Work receives value when it involves loving\nothers. When work can be seen pushing towards the larger goal of people’s needs\nbeing met, then it is work worth doing. Volf defines work as “activity whose primary\ngoal is the creation of products or states of affairs that can satisfy the\nneeds of working <span class=\"GramE\">individuals[</span>‘]…co-creatures” (10).\nThis is to say that work involves that which provides for the needs of another\nhuman or living organism. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">How does what Volf says give work value.\nDoing things that better others in the big picture give work meaning. Also,\nwhen someone is doing something that fits within the definition of work, that\nintrinsically is valuable because it involves providing for the needs of another.\nWhat makes providing for another’s needs worthwhile? The fact that their\nquality of life is improved. What makes improving another’s quality of life\nworthwhile? What makes loving others worthwhile? God loves others, and thus\nhumans doing the same, reflecting this Godly action is also worthwhile. For\nwhat reason does God love? God loves because in His character is the quality of\nloving others. Why does God love others? It pleases Him and makes life better\nfor all. </p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">How does the volunteer work in Lynn align\nwith what Volf writes? The individual acts may seem insignificant, such as\nwaiting in line with a child to play foosball with them, but they are pushing\ntowards the larger goal of this child feeling loved. In this moment, spending\ntime with the child influences them to become a better person (Volf).</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">God and man want the world to come to a\nplace of harmony. Plantinga asserts that “[t]he coming of the kingdom of God\nrepresents a final state of cosmic redemption, in which God and God’s creatures\ndwell together in harmony, righteousness, and delight” (Plantinga 25). He goes\non to say that humans need rest, and thus there must be some work that helps\nenable and facilitate this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">How does what volunteers do help work\ntowards restoration of relationships between people in earth? The Boys &amp;\nGirls club works to providing something essential to human\nflourishing—recreation. The children need this recreation to experience the\nfullness of life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-top:0in;\nmso-margin-bottom-alt:10.0pt;mso-margin-top-alt:0in;mso-add-space:auto;\ntext-indent:.5in;line-height:200%\">God made humans in His image. God worked,\nand because humans bear His image, they can reflect His image. If humans want\nto more fully reflect God’s nature, they should work. Having these reasons for\nwork’s value in mind will help Boys &amp; Girls club volunteers to do better\nwork. Volunteers in Lynn may question the value of their work apart from how it\nserves their own needs. Ahead lie some points for them to consider. In a\nChristian worldview, God instituted man to work in the seemingly perfect world\nof Eden. Work that makes small steps towards a bigger picture of shalom in the\nworld is valuable. Practically, work provides for the needs of others to\nprogress towards shalom. Volunteer work in Lynn provides for those children’s\nneed for care and for good role models. This essay has explored the value of\nwork apart from how it affects the one doing it. A follow up essay should be\nwritten on the importance of volunteer Lynn service as it affects the workers.\nParticipants in Lynn service should keep in mind the bigger picture that their\nlittle steps progress towards. Understanding this important meaning of their\nwork will motivate them to do better work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;\nmargin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;mso-add-space:auto;text-align:center;\ntext-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-font-family:\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;mso-themecolor:text1\">Works Cited<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;\nmargin-left:.5in;mso-add-space:auto;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:200%\">Gusdorf,\nGeorge. <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Traite de l’existence morale</i>.\nParis: Colin, 1949.
