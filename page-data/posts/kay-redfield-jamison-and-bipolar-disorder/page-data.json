It worsened when\nshe was 28; this is when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She was\nliving in pain and chaos, and had increased stress placed upon her with\nadvancements in work. This period was marked by turbulent relationships,\ndamaging decisions, and bizarre spending sprees. She enjoyed and became\naddicted to her seemingly more productive manic “highs,” but soon fell into a\nterrible <span class=GramE>one and a half year</span> long depression. After\nthis she began taking lithium, which she attributes to be the reason she is\nstill alive. After this she revealed her condition to the public. In an\ninterview with Kay by bp, she said, <span style='color:black'>“When we say\nbipolar, it kind of implies there is mania over here,” Jamison adds, moving one\nhand in one direction, “and depression over here”—she sweeps her other hand in\nthe other direction. “That they are on opposite poles. [But] the ancients made\nthe argument years ago that, in fact, mania was just a severe form of\ndepression. … [the term] bipolar is way too tidy.”</span> She has since made\ngroundbreaking progress in helping the medical community understand bipolar\ndisorder.</p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><b>How it has impacted her life<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'>Jamison says that if she had a\nchoice about whether or not to have bipolar, she would choose to have it (being\nthat lithium works for her). She says that she has experienced more because of\nit, that she has experienced higher highs, lower lows, greater laughter because\nof more tears, that she has given and received more love She almost committed\nsuicide (using an overdose of lithium) because of the disorder. However, if she\ndidn&#8217;t have bipolar disorder, she wouldn&#8217;t be as famous, because having the\nillness has allowed her to write textbooks and books that have helped people\nunderstand this mental illness much better.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><b>How she has managed to live with bipolar\ndisorder and function in life<o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><b><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'>Kay Jamison has managed to live with\nbipolar disorder by taking medication that works for her and being open with\nher condition. When she was first prescribed lithium, she refused to take it,\nwhich is common for those with bipolar disorder. After her year and a half long\nbattle with depression, she started taking lithium and credits it with saving\nher life. Back in the 70&#8217;s however, much higher doses of lithium were\nprescribed, which gave her terrible side effects that caused her to be nauseous\nand have a very hard time reading. In addition to medication, she revealed the\nfact that she has bipolar, which also helped her deal with it, as she was able\nto help others struggling with the same condition.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'>She is quoted: <span\nstyle='color:black'>“I believe that curiosity, wonder, and passion are defining\nqualities of imaginative minds and great teachers, that restlessness and\ndiscontent are vital things; and that intense experience and suffering instruct\nus in ways that less intense emotions can never do. … It is important to value\nintellect and discipline, of course, but it is also important to recognize the\npower of irrationality, enthusiasm, and vast energy.”</span></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='line-height:115%'>Sources</p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:115%;\nmso-list:l1 level1 lfo2'><![if !supportLists]><span style='font-family:StarSymbol;\nmso-fareast-font-family:StarSymbol;mso-bidi-font-family:StarSymbol'><span\nstyle='mso-list:Ignore'>•<span style='font:7.0pt \"Times New Roman\"'>&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><a\nhref=\"http://www.caecilian.org/bipolar-disorder/\"><span style='color:windowtext;\ntext-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>http://www.caecilian.org/bipolar-disorder/</span></a></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:115%;\nmso-list:l1 level1 lfo2'><![if !supportLists]><span style='font-family:StarSymbol;\nmso-fareast-font-family:StarSymbol;mso-bidi-font-family:StarSymbol'><span\nstyle='mso-list:Ignore'>•<span style='font:7.0pt \"Times New Roman\"'>&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><a\nhref=\"http://www.moodletter.com/KayRedfieldJamison.htm\"><span style='color:\nwindowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>http://www.moodletter.com/KayRedfieldJamison.htm</span></a></p>\n\n<p class=Standard style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:115%;\nmso-list:l1 level1 lfo2'><![if !supportLists]><span style='font-family:StarSymbol;\nmso-fareast-font-family:StarSymbol;mso-bidi-font-family:StarSymbol'><span\nstyle='mso-list:Ignore'>•<span style='font:7.0pt \"Times New Roman\"'>&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><a\nhref=\"http://www.bphope.com/Item.aspx?id=482\"><span style='color:windowtext;\ntext-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>http://www.bphope.com/Item.aspx?id=482</span></a></p>\n\n</div>\n","title":"Kay Redfield Jamison and bipolar disorder","author":{"node":{"name":"Jacob Stephens"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"link":"/posts/category/biography/","name":"Biography"},{"link":"/posts/category/psychology/","name":"Psychology"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"featuredImage":null},"nextPost":{"title":"The maple tree stood at the gate","uri":"/posts/the-maple-tree-stood-at-the-gate/"},"prevPost":{"title":"Bicycle towed skateboarding: Jacob and Ryan","uri":"/posts/bicycle-towed-skateboarding-jacob-and-ryan/"}},"pageContext":{"databaseId":762,"nextId":318,"prevId":522}},"staticQueryHashes":["2089240339","3862348194","63159454"]}
